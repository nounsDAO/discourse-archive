NounsDAO discussion regarding governance and proposals.

The NounsDAO category is meant to be used for discussing NounsDAO activity and proposals. Only [@Nowners](/groups/nowners), [@NounReps](/groups/nounreps), and [@Nounders](/groups/nounders) are able to post in this top level category. Anyone can create a new proposal in the NounsDAO Proposals ([#nounsdao:nounsdao-proposals](/c/nounsdao/nounsdao-proposals/6)) category.
