For eons, the balance among the universes endured, sustained by the continuous flow of cosmic energy known as **Vitae**. This vital force wove the fabric of existence, maintaining harmony across the realms. However, a mysterious catastrophe deep within the cosmos disrupted the flow of Vitae, causing the energy sources to dwindle. As the energy diminished, once-peaceful relations between universes began to fracture, leading to fierce competition for resources.

During this chaotic period, the legendary universe of **Etherea** , foretold in ancient prophecies, re-emerged. Etherea was the mythical realm responsible for restoring balance when all else failed. Its champions, known as **Nouns** , were summoned to **Crux** , the central **battlefield** of cosmic reconciliation. This arena would be the stage where the fate of all universes would be decided.

As these factions converged at Crux, alliances were formed, and rivalries intensified. The battle for Vitae was not merely a fight for survival but a race to redefine cosmic order. Every clash, every victory, and every defeat at Crux reshaped the energy pathways between universes, either restoring the delicate balance of the multiverse or plunging it further into disarray. The monumental encounters at Crux would determine not only the fate of each realm but also the future structure of the cosmos itself.

Nounstone is a **card game** that emphasizes **strategic thinking** and **planning**. Players start with a set amount of health points and aim to reduce their opponents’ points to zero.

![](../../assets/images/5396/6e70a85dfa2f1dea7b75045e6800b6d29e32ea4b_2_690x408.jpeg)


Each card has **unique powers** and **usage conditions** , which allow for different strategies **every** **game**. The mana system requires players to strategically plan which cards to play and when.

Players aim to obtain **new cards** from **card packs** they unlock as the game progresses, with each card having a **rarity level**.

![](../../assets/images/5396/d07d38c1c730d04a92f486beb787402dc19233d1_2_690x431.jpeg)


The positioning of cards on the battlefield is crucial as it affects attack and defense tactics. Character cards and power-ups further deepen the in-game strategies.

Nounstone regularly organizes tournaments that test players’ skills and offer a competitive environment. This structure encourages players to continuously discover new strategies.

In the game, players can use **cryptocurrency** to **buy card packs** on the **Web3 Nounstone marketplace** and try to pull **legendary cards**.

Players **can also earn** these cards **by playing** , demonstrating that the game **does not** solely rely on a **“pay-to-win”** structure.

The game offers the possibility to create new cards through **card fusion** and to gain in-game resources by "**burning"** excess cards.

Additionally, players **can sell** their **cards** on the **Web3 marketplace** to other players.

In the **Wagering Arena** , players **bet** cryptocurrency against each other, with the winner taking **90%** of the pot and **10%** going to the **DAO pool**. This system not only stimulates competition but also **contributes** to the **growth of the community** **pool**.

  2. **Royal Fee on Resale:** Players can put rare cards from card packs or fusions up for sale on the web marketplace and sell them to other players. 95% of the revenue from this sale goes to the seller and **5%** to the **Nouns DAO treasury**.
  3. **Wagering Arena Commission:** Players bet cryptocurrency against each other, with the winner taking 90% of the pot and **10%** going to the **DAO pool**. (For example both sides bet 20 dollars, the winner gets 36 dollars, 4 dollars is sent to the Nouns DAO treasury.)
