Dear admins. I’m trying to get into the nounish discord to understand more about this project. But I’m just stuck. Even after verifying I cannot see much other than old announcements. Please help.

Old Discord is closed. Hop into the jungle if you want to talk with Nouners: [The Jungle: Nouns DAO](https://discord.gg/GQfErM9f)  
Nouncil is also a great place if you have questions about anything Nouns related. It’s packed with a lot of helpful builders: [Nouncil](https://discord.gg/nouncil)

Hit me up if you need anything and thanks for exploring!

Got it. Thanks. I will join that instead. Maybe should update all the social links.
