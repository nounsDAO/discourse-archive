Hey guys, Since there are no discord, do we know or can we speculate that this nft will bring some utility in the future? I am gonna mint one regardless for me owning something from an OG project

I haven’t heard of any utility for the ‘This is Nouns’ mint. If you have ideas, you probably want to jump into The Jungle where most of the Nouner conversations are happening now.

Hi guys I’m a noob looking to purchase a noun NFT. I connect my wallet but I’m not sure what to do next i have tried bidding and connecting, am I missing a step? I have a coinbase wallet. Some assistance would be greatly appreciated.
