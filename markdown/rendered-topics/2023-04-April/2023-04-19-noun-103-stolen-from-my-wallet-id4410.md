Hi all, my wallet was emptied last week and my Noun #103 was sold on OpenSea before I knew what happened. It was purchased by suicide.eth and flipped to another collector of Lil Nouns at address 0xE6397F9A08F456541814efcE5dbB26e37Ed44268.

Iâ€™m asking if there is any thing I can do to try and recover this NFT as it is by the far my most valuable and I wanted to hold it for years to come. Is there a way to contact this person? Does anyone know anything about this collector?

Feel free to reach out to me on here or [@cc5alive](/u/cc5alive) on Twitter.

Thanks for your time.

Apparently a massive exploit has drained many wallets of ETH and NFTs. Information in the Twitter thread below. Key lesson: use a hardware wallet and/or rotate wallets.

Afaik, no one has determined the source of their compromise. Multiple devices have been forensic'd. Nothing. The only known commonalities are: \- Keys were created btwn 2014-2022 \- Folks are those who are more crypto native than most (e.g. multiple addresses, work in space, etc)
