**tl;dr**  
We learned from our Prop 265 that the 2 main reasons nouners were against the prop was:

  1. Lack of distribution / marketing strategy and budget
  2. Low quality product design



Therefore the team has decided to run a Design Contest to address issue no. 2

**Design Contest**  
We need a compelling design for our Noun Wet Wipes packaging. That’s where you come in ![:smiley:](../../assets/images/4411/smiley.png)  
Designers may submit their design of what Noun Wet Wipes should look like and stand a chance to win the grand prize of **1.5 Eth** should the prop succeed and that your design was chosen by the DAO.

Even if your design wasn’t the most popular, 2nd place to 5th place contestants still share a pool of **0.5 Eth** as consolation. ![:heart_eyes:](../../assets/images/4411/heart_eyes.png)

**Contest Period**  
The contest will run from 19/4/2023 to 3/5/2023 11pm ET

**What’s the criteria for Winning?**  
There’s no set criteria for winning, your designs will be judged through a popularity vote. Nouners can choose the design they think is the best when voting on the prop itself. That being said, we believe the winning design should…

  1. Pop!
  2. Resonates with a fun audience!
  3. Interactive!
  4. Welcoming!
  5. Nounish!!!



Ultimately, these Noun Wet Wipes purpose is to proliferate the Nouns brand.

**Contest Mechanics**  
Contestants are supposed to submit 4 designs

  1. The wrapper design
  2. The flap design
  3. The display box for holding 12 packs design
  4. The 3D mockup of the product (optional)



Templates for the design as follows but please ignore the design on them.

![Nouns_Package_Line_01_page-0001](../../assets/images/4411/7a6328de31b2df442c4b05f773bbf1f9560ded3b_2_476x500.jpeg)


  
_Wrapper template - whiteout part is to print the information required by regulating authorities_  
_Due to manufacturing constraints, please limit the number of colors used to a maximum of 5_

![Flap Dimension_page-0001](../../assets/images/4411/fca2b1550809bbdf5fc7d03c59d4d244ebcbf679_2_500x500.jpeg)


  
_Flap template - this is the opening to the wipes. The flap opens from the top._

![Display Box Template](../../assets/images/4411/5f69994443bf8da501359bd3e148117c9339e245_2_500x500.jpeg)


  
_Display box template_

There’s no template for 3D mockup as it will not be required for manufacturing but it will undoubtedly increase your chances of winning.

**How to submit your designs?**  
Just reply this discourse thread and attach the your jpegs together with your eth address (where you will receive the price). Should you win please email your design files to [noun426@proton.me](mailto:noun426@proton.me)

Looks good as a base template for the manufacturer!

How about the 5 colour cap? If you changed it to a 5 colour limit, would the effect remain the same?

Hiya, the 5 colours does include black but not white. Essentially the white is the base colour of the wrapper.

The display box doubles as the box holding the wipes. It can be opened and ‘torn’ into a display box. I have labelled the display box dimensions below. Thanks for the question !!!

thanks for the quick reply!  
is the display box limited to 5-color printing as well?

before I continue working on the display box, here’s a really rough mockup by drawing over one of your example photos

thanks again, wanted to check again regarding the actual ad area from the print template vs the mockup shown does it fold over and down towards the base of the display box as illustrated below?  


![fold](../../assets/images/4411/52df86ce21a1d419d60bca2bccea5425b5d818eb_2_599x500.jpeg)


also please find attached another rough mockup image  
this time including the display box

Your illustration of the display box is spot on! However you can increase the ad space above a bit more if there’s a cut out, which is possible as long as its attached to the box below. See pic.

GM everyone!

Due to the somewhat short timeframe I’m not able to provide everything asked for in the original post. The display box design and the print-ready files will of course be provided in case the design is chosen.  
Anyways!  
The idea is based around the fact that the flap is in the shape of a pill so naturally it should feature a pill head. The 5 color limit is kept by using a diffusion dither effect for the gradients (see 3rd image).

Thank you for all your submissions ![:heart_eyes:](../../assets/images/4411/heart_eyes.png) They all look awesome!!!  
I have received some DM whereby some contestants are unable to submit if they attached their eth add together with their designs. It was an oversight on our part as we did not take into account the community guidelines for using this discourse. Please resubmit your designs without the eth address. We will get in touch directly when the time comes to send the prizes out. Sorry for the inconvenience caused. Thanks again for all your effort!!!
