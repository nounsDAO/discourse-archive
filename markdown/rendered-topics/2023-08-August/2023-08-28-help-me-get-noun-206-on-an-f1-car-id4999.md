Noun community,  
I entered Noun 206 into Kraken’s RearWingTakeover contest and was selected as one of 20 finalist. Now I need a quick vote from you in the form of a like.

As you might be aware, Noun 206 depicts Alan Turing’s Turing Machine. It’s only fitting that the greatest British invention should be riding the fastest F1 car from British racing legend, Frank Williams.

Six of the 20 finalist will make it on the car. I need your vote by liking and/or retweeting the following post. You small act here can result in some great Noun visibility.
