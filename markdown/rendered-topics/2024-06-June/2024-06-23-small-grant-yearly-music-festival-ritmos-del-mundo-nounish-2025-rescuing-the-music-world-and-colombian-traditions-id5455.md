**Objective:** Addressing the critical issue of limited support and accessibility for local artists in Colombia focusing on cultural traditions from around the world, ensuring these cultural expressions are accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status. This year, the festival is at risk of being discontinued due to financial constraints, making this funding request particularly urgent and crucial.

#### Problem Statement

**Lack of Support for Local Artists:** Local artists with unique and culturally significant projects struggle to find platforms and support to share their work, limiting their professional growth and the cultural diversity available to the public.

**Restricted Public Access to Cultural Expressions:** Many people, especially from lower-income backgrounds, do not have the means to experience and learn from the rich cultural traditions of Colombia and the world, creating a cultural divide.

#### Mission

Ritmos del Mundo is dedicated to celebrating and promoting cultural diversity through the arts by creating inclusive spaces where musicians, artists, and communities can come together to share, learn, and grow. The mission aligns with positive change by:

  * Preserving and promoting cultural heritage
  * Ensuring inclusivity and accessibility to cultural experiences
  * Building community and social cohesion
  * Supporting local artists and entrepreneurs
  * Promoting environmental stewardship
  * Providing educational opportunities
  * Creating educational Media content (<https://www.youtube.com/@festivalritmosdelmundo> \- [Podcast](https://festivalritmosdelmundo.com/podcast/))



#### Past Activities

Since 2019, Ritmos del Mundo has:

  * Hosted annual festivals, including opening day events in Bogotá and three-day festivals in the mountains, featuring concerts, workshops, and artisan markets.
  * Organized workshops on music, dance, and environmental conservation.
  * Held virtual events during the pandemic, including workshops, concerts, and film screenings.
