I am starting the [Nouns Blockchain Review](https://nounsblockchainreview.substack.com/) and am writing this here to seek feedback and start a conversation about what I currently have and where the community would like to see this go.

With the help of ChatGPT, I’ve boiled the publication process down to what has been written [here](https://nounsblockchainreview.substack.com/about)

The mission of The Nouns Blockchain Review aims to platform novel and creative nounish ideas written by a full host of nounish thinkers. From well-known and tenured thought leaders in the crypto space to first-time publishers still in undergrad, Nouns Blockchain Review wants to publish your work, proliferate the nouns brand, and continue [The Nouns Virtuous Cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9).

Welcome to any and all feedback.  
To follow the process or to [submit work](https://forms.gle/tddH7DkoERraUwpVA) to be published please check us out on Twitter [@NounsReview](https://twitter.com/NounsReview)

p.s. made our logo w/the nouns playground, worked like a charm
