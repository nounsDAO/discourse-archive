Dear Nouns DAO Community,

First and foremost, congratulations on the resilience and strength of this community during challenging times.

I am new to the Nouns DAO and would like to suggest organizing the website links and funded projects more systematically. This will make onboarding easier, as I found it difficult to follow up with all the information.

Over the past few days, I have been researching the project, reading through all the documentation, Notion site links, and Nouniversary details. However, I encountered several issues with many URLs due to invalid SSL certificates or broken links.

**Below is a table listing the websites and resources related to Nouns DAO that I tried to access but found to be non-functional:**

No | Site | Scope | Operational | Error  
---|---|---|---|---  
1 | `nouns.party` | Nouns Party | Yes |   
2 | `nounsone.wtf` | Nouns One | Yes |   
3 | `noun-o-talk.cohostpodcasting.com` | Noun-o-talk Cohost Podcasting | Yes |   
4 | `nouns.blog` | Nouns Blog | Yes |   
5 | `prop.house` | Prop House | Yes |   
6 | `nounsvision.com` | Nouns Vision | Yes |   
7 | `nounsapp.wtf` | Nouns App | Yes |   
8 | `fomonouns.wtf` | Fomo Nouns | Yes |   
9 | `discourse.nouns.wtf` | Discourse Nouns | Yes |   
10 | `nouns.center/ideas` | Nouns Center | No | 500 Error  
11 | `nouns.center/assets` | Nouns Center | No | 404 Error  
12 | `nouns.center/dev` | Nouns Center | No | **“Watch Stream” button** → `nounish.tv` \- This site can’t be reached  
13 | `nouns.center/dev` | Nouns Center | No | Subgraph **“Read More” button** → This subgraph’s endpoints are disabled  
14 | `nouns.center/dev` | Nouns Center | No | **“Submit Your Project”** button → 404 Error  
15 | `nouns.center/talent` | Nouns Center | No | **“Add Yourself”** → 404 Error  
16 | `voter.wtf` | Voter WTF | No | Application Error  
17 | `nouns.com` | Nouns .com | No | Various broken pages  
18 | `nounsone.wtf` | Nouns One | No | **“WATCH THE COMMERCIAL” button** – Video is not Available  
19 | `nounsone.wtf` | Nouns One | No | **“DOWNLOAD COLORING BOOKS” button** → `nounsense.wtf` → Error  
20 | `noundust.wtf` | Noun Dust | No | This site can’t be reached  
21 | `nouns.coffee` | Nouns Coffee | No | 403 Error  
22 | `nounsone.wtf` | Nouns One | No | **Nouns Strategic Funding Works** → Account does not exist  
23 | `studio1.wtf` | Studio1 | No | 403 Error  
24 | `nouns.center/groups` | Nouns Center | No | **“Add Your Group” button** – Returns 500 Error  
25 | `nouns.center/groups` | **Invalid URL Discord Communities** | No | Nounish Labs, Vessel Verse, Nouns University, NSFW, pNouns, NounsDAOChinese, Nouns Esports, Nounish Network State, NounPunks, NOUNWORKS, NounsDAO Africa, Social Nouns, 3D Nouns, Bone Zone  
  
I suggest removing all broken links to enhance User Experience and ensure that resources are easily accessible.

As there may be more projects with broken links, these are my findings thus far while exploring the Nouns DAO.

Hi Steve thanks for ur comments. im new to and really feel the same way… so i though about making maybe like a simple visual intro board map in [miro.com](http://miro.com)  
and of course make it accesible to any 1 so its easier to navigate through nouns DAO world !

i started a very basic bad [mural](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/b0ZhYzZqM0tDWmEyMmRWM3RNVm9Cb0pRdWRvTnRGVWFGNjhjdmFFa3Q4bUdyRUlGNVdCV0J4TXFROEtMc1Z0a3wzNDU4NzY0NTY4NzA2NzA5OTAwfDI=?share_link_id=409652216570), so fast its embarrasing… but its something we (if u would like?) can organize and work to construct …afterall makes the nouns brand bigger (democratize!)
