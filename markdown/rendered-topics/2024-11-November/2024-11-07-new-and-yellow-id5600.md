Hi Guys,

Iâ€™m new in the community. My journey with Nouns began few days ago, cause Iâ€™ve looked up for the learning paths on the Ledger academy site and I couldnâ€™t not get attracted into nerdy merch.

Iâ€™m 34 years old and Iâ€™m from Poland. From 7-8 years Iâ€™m living in Berlin, Germany. Life isnâ€™t easy on me, cause now itâ€™s the moment Iâ€™m able to think about myself. I have 7 younger siblings and Iâ€™ve spent most of my life assured Iâ€™m not to choose what I want to do in my life, cause IT was too expensive

Iâ€™m a neurodivergent person, learning for the freelancer career

I would like to get to know the learning developers rules and get yellow duck NFT for my profile picture

Yep, Iâ€™m into yellow ducks a lot ![:nerd_face:](../../assets/images/5600/nerd_face.png)

Feel free to DM me
