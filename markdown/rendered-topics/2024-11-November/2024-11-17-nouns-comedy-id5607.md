Overview:

This proposal seeks a one-month sponsorship from Nouns DAO to support a dedicated Comedy Open Mic space at Accidental Chaos in Los Angeles, CA. This space will serve as a welcoming hub for comedians and comedy enthusiasts, fostering growth, connection, and creative collaboration without charging performers for stage time. With Nouns DAO’s support, we can ensure an inclusive and vibrant comedy scene that benefits all involved.

Objective:

The aim is to create an environment where comedians can improve their craft through regular performances. By removing the cost barrier, we can attract a diverse range of performers and build a supportive community atmosphere. This project will help identify emerging talent and could lead to curated shows that spotlight standout acts.

Target Audience:

The primary audience includes comedy enthusiasts who enjoy live shows and discovering fresh talent. Upcoming comedians will benefit from a no-cost opportunity to perform and refine their material, while established comics can test new material in a low-stakes, supportive environment. Other comedy venues might also take notice, leading to potential collaborations or talent showcases.

Key Features:

This Open Mic will provide free stage time to all participants, fostering an inclusive space where comics can receive feedback and grow. It will serve as a platform for networking, allowing performers to connect, share ideas, and build future collaborations. Successful participants may also be invited to perform in curated shows, expanding their reach and drawing larger audiences.

Sponsorship Details:

Nouns DAO’s sponsorship would cover essential costs such as venue rental, promotional efforts, and basic equipment. In return, Nouns DAO will receive branding opportunities in the venue, at events, and in all related promotional materials.

Expected Outcomes:

This initiative will help strengthen the comedy community by creating a regular space for performance without financial stress, encouraging collaboration and skill development. It will create a pipeline for new talent as performers hone their acts with consistent stage time. Nouns DAO’s brand will benefit from association with an authentic, grassroots creative project, aligning with its mission to foster community and innovation.

Future Vision:

If successful, this one-month trial could expand into larger comedy initiatives or collaborations with other venues, potentially leading to long-term partnerships between Nouns DAO and the comedy scene.

Conclusion:

Sponsoring this Comedy Open Mic aligns with Nouns DAO’s mission to support creativity, community, and the arts. This project benefits up-and-coming and established comedians alike and aligns Nouns DAO with a vibrant, community-focused cultural project.

Hi! Full disclosure: I’m not a Noun (yet), but I intend to be soon! I’m very new to this community and still learning ![:slightly_smiling_face:](../../assets/images/5607/slightly_smiling_face.png)

For those who can’t make it to LA, would you be open to livestreaming it or recording it to go on YT? I’d really like to watch it!

I’m still trying to learn about the community. I’ve watched a few videos and read some posts, but I’m having trouble nailing down the ethos of Nouners. Do you know of anything that can help a newcomer out?
