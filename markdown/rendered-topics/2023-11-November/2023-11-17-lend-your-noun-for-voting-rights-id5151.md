Let’s say you own a Noun, which gives you voting rights on new proposals. Is it possible for people to “buy your vote”, and automate this process? Also, what does the process look like on the other end (the person buying the vote)?

Or it seems like this is what it is: <https://www.federation.wtf/governance-pools/0x0f722d69B3D8C292E85F2b1E5D9F4439edd58F1e/437>

But why is there only 3 votes? Have just 3 people delegated their voting rights to the protocol? I’m surprised it’s this low.
