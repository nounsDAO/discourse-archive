# Description

Guess the next [fork](https://nouns.wtf/fork) and get a reward if accurate.

# Details

Guess the Noun number that will correspond to the next fork execution (next well be #3). For example, the latest fork, [fork 2](https://nouns.wtf/fork/2), was executed on Nov 16, 2023, which corresponds to [Nouns 915].

**Any guess within 10 days will recieve 0.1 ETH**. For example, qualifing guess for [fork 2](https://nouns.wtf/fork/2) would be in the range 905-925.

For now, this game is informal on discourse. If there is enough demand, we can formalize this as smart contract.

Noun 1130 / `0x1cef5a9eba1471a266d0fcdc7d1e776bcd7aba6a`

Totally random guess though. Might actually be possible to get reasonable guesses if someone looks at book value arb and new 30% fork requirement.
