Hi guys, where can I get the IP rules for Nouns? I tried to create a new primitive by mixing game theory, the base network and clanker and using the nouns that is in the auction of the day called NIL, by the way it is a very powerful Nouns.

my project was taken down

  * base scan
  * uniswap
  * clanker (clanker launched it but can’t display it)



Is this normal? The correct way is for me to create a DAO and then a token, and not use a nouns NFT to be a precursor to a DAO, if anyone can help me I will be very happy.
