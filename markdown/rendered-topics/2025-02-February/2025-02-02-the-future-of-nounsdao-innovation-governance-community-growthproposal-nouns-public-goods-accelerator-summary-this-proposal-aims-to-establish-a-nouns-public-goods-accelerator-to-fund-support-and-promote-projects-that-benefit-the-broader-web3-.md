Proposal: Nouns Public Goods Accelerator

This proposal aims to establish a Nouns Public Goods Accelerator to fund, support, and promote projects that benefit the broader web3 ecosystem and society. By leveraging Nouns DAO’s treasury, we can empower builders working on open-source tools, educational initiatives, sustainability projects, and decentralized infrastructure.

  1. Fund Open-Source Innovation – Support the development of free and permissionless tools that improve the blockchain ecosystem.

  2. Promote Web3 Education– Back initiatives that onboard newcomers and educate users on DAOs, NFTs, and decentralized governance.

  3. Advance Sustainability & Public Good Projects– Finance climate-focused, humanitarian, or impact-driven projects.

  4. Strengthen Nouns DAO’s Influence– Position Nouns DAO as a leader in funding public goods, enhancing its reputation and long-term sustainability.




Implementation Plan

  1. Establish a Grant Committee


  * Form a working group within Nouns DAO to review, evaluate, and approve proposals.
  * Create a transparent decision-making process with community voting.


  2. Funding Rounds


  * Open applications for projects seeking funding.
  * Define funding criteria (e.g., alignment with Nouns ethos, scalability, sustainability).
  * Distribute grants in stages based on milestones.


  3. Community Involvement & Partnerships


  * Engage with the Nouns community to propose and vote on impactful projects.
  * Partner with organizations like Gitcoin, Ethereum Foundation, or other DAOs to co-fund initiatives.


  4. Tracking & Reporting


  * Require funded projects to provide regular updates on progress.
  * Publish reports on fund allocation and project impact.



Budget & Treasury Allocation

  * Allocate X ETH from the Nouns DAO treasury for the first round of grants.
  * Adjust funding levels based on DAO voting and project performance.
  * Consider long-term sustainability strategies (e.g., staking treasury funds to generate yield).

Interesting. How do you define “Public Goods”?

Supporting the ecosystem, especially builders, is amazing, but before achieving this, a much more detailed and well-structured roadmap should be created.
