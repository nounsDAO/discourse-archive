## **Who is Unchained Elephants?**

Unchained Elephants is a project dedicated to improving elephant welfare by rescuing elephants from dire conditions and relocating them to ethical sanctuaries. Our mission includes educating travelers, establishing an education center, and using NFTs to support these initiatives. Over the past 12 months, we’ve rescued three elephants—Kanoon, Kham Phaeng, and Mongkoln—whose stories have reached over 5 million viewers through media coverage, including features on The Dodo and Yahoo News.

We are a web3 project, though most of our community members and supporters are from web2, helping us crowdfund our rescue initiatives. On teh web3 side, we will be migrating an NFT collection to BASE to onboard and proliferate our message to new audiences and animal lovers, after working on other chains, BASE has the easiest onboarding with the smart wallet and no doubt we will contribute to onboard our audience.

To date, Unchained Elephants has donated $86,000 towards the care and rescue of three elephants, as well as the care of eight elephants during the pandemic when we started.

As part of our initiatives, we are currently seeking funding for a fourth elephant rescue, a rescue fund, and funding for the post-production of our pilot episode featuring the rescue of our baby elephant Mongkoln. This latest rescue was documented in 4K for our pilot episode, UNCHAINED, by a filmmaker focused on animal and environmental issues.

**#1 \- Elephant Rescue Fund - Budget: 38,700 USD**

We are working on our 4th elephant rescue, the rescue date is tentatively on at the end of August to the first week of September. In our previous rescues, we rallied our community to raise funds through traditional crowdfunding and sales of NFTs (80/20). This time, the goal will be to launch a fully web3 elephant Noun rescue, currently we have 3 potential cases we are looking into it but there a lot of due diligence as well as preparation to relocate an elephant take up to 8 weeks. The most critical side is that we need to ensure that the rescued elephant will not be replaced by another, thereby fostering the elephant trade. We work with accredited elephant sanctuaries by World Animal Protection, so we carefully relocate the elephants to an accredited elephant sanctuary.

**#2 \- Unchained Pilot Episode - Budget: 35,000 USD**

As we are committed to improving elephant welfare in Thailand and Asia, we are working in tandem with the rescues on a pilot for our Docuseries. Our goal is to inspire global audiences to join the conservation effort and make a lasting impact on elephant conservation, and with the sponsorship of The Nouns, we can make this happen through our pilot episode. This first episode of UNCHAINED, sets the story, and tone, introducing a group of passionate and dedicated elephant rescuers in Thailand. It demonstrates that anyone can embark on a journey to create an impact larger than themselves with a mission of spreading awareness about public goods and making real-world impact with the support of a community & web3. UNCHAINED showcases the rescue of a baby elephant Mongkoln who was destined to entratin humans for food at a large tourist attraction. The story of struggle and hardship, of the rescue and brings its emotional rollercoaster with a happy and positive ending.

His story was documented by Erik Crown, an environmentalist and filmmaker who recently produced the **documentary Harambe**. With him, we aim to develop a compelling episode that will eventually evolve into a documentary series.
