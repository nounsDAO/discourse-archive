## Simple Summary

NounsVision is a biweekly content series designed to bridge the information gap between Nouns DAO governance forum activities and social media platforms where most community members are active. The initiative transforms governance discussions into accessible, engaging content including main videos, short-form clips, monthly research reports, and accompanying social posts that inform Noun holders about governance activities they would otherwise miss.

## Motivation

Currently, there exists a significant information vacuum between governance activities happening within the Nouns DAO forums and social media platforms where most community members spend their time. Many Nouns holders remain unaware of key governance proposals and discussions simply because they don’t regularly check governance forums or attend community calls.

This proposal addresses this critical information gap by bringing governance content directly to the platforms where community members are already active. By transforming complex governance information into accessible, engaging formats, NounsVision ensures that important DAO activities aren’t confined to governance forums that many users never visit.

The consequences of this information vacuum are clear: community members who are active on social media but not in governance forums remain uninformed about important protocol developments and decisions. The Nouns DAO deserves consistent, high-quality content that brings governance information to the platforms where the community actually spends its time.

## Specification

NounsVision will deliver biweekly content over a 3-month period, with the following content mix:

Biweekly Content Package (twice per month):

  * Main Video (1 per package):

    * 5-7 minute in-depth governance explainer video
    * Alternating between three key categories: 
      * Governance Updates: Summaries of recent activities, decisions, and developments
      * Delegate Spotlight: Profiles of Noun holders and their governance approaches
      * Nouns DAO How-To: Educational content on governance participation
  * Short-form Videos (4 per month):

    * 30-60 second clips optimized for social media
    * Key takeaways from the main video
    * Standalone governance insights and call-to-actions
    * Quick explainers on upcoming proposals or voting deadlines
  * Monthly Research Report (1 per month):

    * Comprehensive analysis of ongoing proposals
    * Summary of governance activities from the past month
    * Key metrics and insights about governance participation
    * Future outlook and important upcoming votes
  * Accompanying Tweets (4 per month):

    * Supplementary social posts to amplify the research report
    * Designed for engagement and sharing
    * Strategic posting schedule to maximize visibility



## Implementation Timeline:

  * Week 1-2 (Preparation): Research existing governance structures, establish content templates, set up production workflows
  * Week 3-4 (Launch): Produce first content package, create social media assets, establish publishing calendar
  * Months 2-3 (Regular Production): Deliver biweekly content packages and monthly research reports
  * End of Month 3: Community feedback call to evaluate impact and discuss potential extension



## Budget

_We propose a monthly budget of 3,000 USDC for the 3-month engagement period._
