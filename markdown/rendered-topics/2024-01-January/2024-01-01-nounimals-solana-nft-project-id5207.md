Anyone interested in an “Animals Head Only” Nouns DAO deriv Solana NFT Project called “Nounimals”. I’ll do art & marketing materials, website design etc…

I just can’t believe an auction style Nouns DAO inspired project has not launched on Solana. As a multi-year Solana NFT ecosystem participant I think it would be welcome with open arms.
