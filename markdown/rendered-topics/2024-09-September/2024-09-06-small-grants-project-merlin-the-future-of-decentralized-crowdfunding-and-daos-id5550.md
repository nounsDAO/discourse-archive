Hello **Nouns** ,

I’d like to share some exciting details about our project and explore how Nouns can collaborate with us.

With Project Merlin, we can expand Nouns’ DAO mechanics. Through this partnership, Nouns NFT holders could become direct members of the Project Merlin community and actively participate in DAO processes. Project Merlin, which offers a unique governance model providing continuous earning opportunities, can extend these benefits to Nouns NFT holders as well. Additionally, Small Grant applications could be managed directly through Project Merlin, offering a more streamlined and trackable process.

I’d love to briefly introduce Project Merlin to you.
