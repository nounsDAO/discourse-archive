**Overview** :  
I want to propose a project to develop an on-chain coin flip game on the Base mainnet. The idea is simple: players can play, decentralized coin flip game, and the profits we generate will be used to buy floor Nouns from OpenSea at the end of each month. This will bring more liquidity to Nouns.

**Objectives** :

  1. **Create a Fair Game on Base** : We’ll build a coin flip game that players can trust, offering them a straightforward 50/50 betting chance.
  2. **Use Profits for Noun Purchases** : The profits we make will go directly toward buying the most affordable Nouns on OpenSea every month, contributing to the Nouns community.
  3. **Support the Nouns Ecosystem** : By regularly acquiring floor Nouns, we aim to enhance the overall market and increase interest in the Nouns brand.



**Detailed Description** :

**1\. Game Mechanics** :

  * **How It Works** : Players will connect their wallets and place bets by choosing heads or tails. The outcome will be determined using Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to ensure everything is fair and transparent.
  * **Profit Collection** : We’ll take a small fee from each bet, which will be set aside in a smart contract for our monthly Noun purchases.



**2\. Monthly Noun Purchases** :

  * **Managing Profits** : At the end of each month, we’ll take the accumulated profits and use them to sweep the floor for Nouns on OpenSea, focusing on the least expensive options.



**3\. Funding Request** :  
We’re looking for a total of 3 ETH to cover the development and launch of this project, broken down as follows:

  * **Smart Contract Development** : 1 ETH
  * **Front-End Development** : TBD
  * **Security Audits** : TBD
  * **Marketing and Community Outreach** : 1 ETH
  * **Operational Costs (like hosting and VRF fees)** : 1 ETH



**4\. Roadmap** :

  * **Phase 1: Development (2-3 WEEKS)** : We’ll finalize the game mechanics and integrate Chainlink VRF on the Base mainnet.
  * **Phase 2: Front-End Development (2-3 WEEKS)** : Build an easy-to-use interface and conduct thorough testing.
  * **Phase 3: Security Audits (DEPENDS)** : Make sure everything is secure and functioning as it should.
  * **Phase 4: Deployment and Marketing** : Launch the game on Base and start promoting it to attract players.
  * **Phase 5: First Noun Purchase (1st Month After Launch)** : Use the profits to buy our first floor Nouns at the end of the first month.



**5\. Value to the Nouns Ecosystem** :

  * **Boosting Liquidity** : By buying floor Nouns, we can help improve liquidity in the market.
