While researching about Nouns, I realized that the main Discord server is no longer active, and people are getting stuck while trying to verify themselves.

It might be a good idea to create a new Discord server and make it active. If necessary, a team managing social media could be formed, and they could either be funded occasionally or work voluntarily as **Noun Angels**.
