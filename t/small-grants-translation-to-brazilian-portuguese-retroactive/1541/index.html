<p><strong>TLDR: 0.5eth to reimburse translation that was already submitted as a <a href="https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/483" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pull request</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>
<p>Translate Nouns.wtf to Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Brazilian population is about 200 million people, most do not speak english. There are also many other  countries an territories that have portuguese as an official language, such as Portugal, Angola, Cabo Verde, Mozambique, Macau and others.</p>
<p>Also, the translation file can be reused in future (or existing) forks/derivative projects.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>I started building “hOur Nouns” a Nouns fork with auctions every hour. <a href="https://prop.house/proposal/134" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">I submitted a proposal to prop house about it</a>. After that, I started translating to Brazilian Portuguese and the <a href="http://hournouns.wtf/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">translation can be seen here (still on rinkeby) http://hournouns.wtf</a>.</p>
<p>Another reference to the translation was made in <a href="/t/nounsdao-brazil/1498">another proposal</a> by <span class="mention">@thebeautyandthepunk</span></p>
<p><strong>Current Status</strong></p>
<p>The translation is mostly done and a <a href="https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/483" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pull request</a> was already made to the nouns repository a week ago. From a list of 229 items/expressions, 216 were translated. There are only 13 items still missing.</p>
<p><strong>Plan</strong></p>
<p>1 - Finish the translation. There is not much left to do. I just need some help figuring out where the remaining 13 items are used so that I can confirm that the translation is correct for the context where the expression/sentence/word is used. And that is it.<br/>
2 - It would be good if someone else could review the translation. As stated above, the translation can be seen in the following url: <a href="http://hournouns.wtf/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://hournouns.wtf/</a><br/>
3 - And the final step would be to accept the <a href="https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/483" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">existing pull request</a>.</p>

<p>I would be extremely happy to see this done.  All languages really. 0.5 eth seems quite fair. please reach out to me in discord.  I would be happy to help you track down where the words are used. I am sure that <span class="mention">@thebeautyandthepunk</span> can help find someone to review the translations.</p>
