<p>All-women League of Legends team ⌐◨-◨</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>Build an all-women League of Legends team and fund its participation in the qualifiers of the IGNIS Cup, the first official championship of the category in Brazil ⌐◨-◨</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>On September 20, 2022, Riot Games announced the Ignis Cup, Brazil’s first professional women’s League of Legends (LoL) circuit. Santander (<a href="https://www.santanderbank.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.santanderbank.com/</a>) and Heineken (<a href="http://www.heineken.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.heineken.com</a>) are partners, and in-person finals were announced. The championship continues the LoL Game Changers project, which included initiatives for women looking to play professional tournaments, and act as casters or MOBA analysts. The action will take place between October 13 and November 12, and will have its grand finale played at Riot Games studios in Brazil.</p>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>League of Legends is the most popular esports in Brazil, with thousands of fans who follow the teams on major streaming platforms like YouTube and Twitch. Unfortunately, the current esports landscape offers notably few opportunities for women. In collaboration with NounsBR, Nouns Esports Pod recently funded a women’s Valorant team in Brazil to participate in national competitions. Now our brand could be at the forefront of women’s teams, first with Valorant and now with LoL.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Project managers have chosen two coaches with vast experience with LoL and women’s training to promote a trial with 14 players and select the best among them to build a team. The team formed will be supported during the Goddess qualifiers of the Ignis Cup. Goddess Cups one and two, operated by Gamers Club, will occur from the 13th-16th and the 20th-23rd of October, respectively. The action will be streamed through Gamers Club channels on Twitch. The average number of concurrent views in male LoL disputes is 40.000, with finals around 200.000 views.</p>

<p>I came to say this very thing. They are already specialized in this and can much better gauge the market value of such a sponsorship. <span class="mention">@maty</span> is involved I believe. He is a super helpful person.</p>

<p>yep, I am in the pod actually. and we were talking about this very issue and that’s why we’re not pursuing this prop.<br/>
looking forward to other esports props with NFT-friendly communities (looking at you, Riot).</p>

<p>me too, actually. the team thought it was a big ask again from us from the pod. would ask for the second round of funding (that could otherwise come from NounsBR) from the pod, and see how they’d feel about funding that part. in any case… looking forward to other opportunities where we (web3/NFTs) are welcomed <img alt=":purple_heart:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/purple_heart.png?v=12" title=":purple_heart:" width="20"/></p>

<p>Is this being supported by nounsesports? and don’t you think the time is too short to test <strong>14 players</strong> for a championship that happens in <strong>11 days</strong>? Me and P12 are running a prop of valorant in brazil and we had 1 month of training and we think it was too rushed, maybe this training time would not be ideal.</p>
