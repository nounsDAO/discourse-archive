<p><strong>Background</strong> :</p>
<p>Lo-Fi music is a genre of music that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It is characterized by its calming and relaxing atmosphere, created by incorporating natural sounds such as raindrops and whispers into the music. The short, repetitive rhythms and mellow tones of Lo-Fi music make it a popular choice for those looking to focus and relax.</p>

<p>I have conducted research on the popularity of Lo-Fi music and found that it has been gaining traction in the music industry. For example, the Lofi Girl YouTube channel, the largest Lo-Fi YouTube channel, has grown rapidly in the past year and now has over 11 million subscribers. Furthermore, people have commented positively on the ability of Lo-Fi music to improve concentration and provide a relaxing atmosphere.</p>

<p>Your prop has more details and that is awesome. I personally know that I would use this all the time and would have it bookmarked in the browser.</p>
<p>From a numbers stand point, lo-fi could actually attract large amounts of new and repeat users. Lo-fi is also easy to digest, non issue related music, which makes it safe to fund.</p>
<p>The animation work is very nice and will add a professional and dynamic element to the project. Including a collaboration and marketing budget is important. That is an important part of the initial and on-going proliferation. Perhaps you could work with <span class="mention">@BigshotKlim</span> since the paper noggles are called Lo-Fi Noggles.</p>
<p>This seems like a good experiment and one that can be achieved, providing art, music and promotion. Evergreen music content is very valuable. Sounds like a win.</p>
