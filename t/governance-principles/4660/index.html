<p>After been active in the decentralized blockchain ecosystem since 2015, I have decided to pursue a PhD on decentralized blockchain governance and am interviewing a handful of projects, and would love to include NOUNS in my list. Is there anyone available who can - on behalf of NOUNS - answers 7 questions?</p>
<p>Am looking for someone who can represent NOUNSâ€™s thinking, and appreciates/understands the philosophy of a DAO.</p>
<p>Not looking for the what (for instance a set opinion on forks), but more for why (how you come to such an opinion).</p>
<p>Goal is to get a better insight in principles behind decentralized governance, that hopefully will help educate and support future projects.</p>
<p>Look forward to getting responses.</p>
