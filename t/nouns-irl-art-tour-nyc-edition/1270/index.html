<p>Hi frens, hope everyone is doing well!</p>
<p>Its been a really cool past week for us as we were able to officially launch the Nouns ios app (proposal 6) and share it with you all. The feedback from everyone has been insanely positive! We are very excited to continue building with and for the community and are looking forward to submitting this next proposal for review. We hope that we can bring this project to life and would love your feedback about what we’ve put together!!</p>

(Microsoft Surface Mural, Jasper Wong)</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>Let’s bring Nouns to IRL and reach millions of people through a global art tour starting with Nouns IRL in NYC. This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20-23) and will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>a hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://www.powwowworldwide.com/</a>), the mural will be viewable from June 20 - July 10 and will promote NFT culture by highlighting several well known projects with Nouns at the center</li>
<li>Nouns IRL meetup and ice cream activation</li>
<li>website which will be used to commemorate the mural and to onboard newcomers to Nouns DAO</li>
</ul>
<p>The activation is estimated to generate ~2.5M impressions. The total amount being requested is 130 ETH.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this IRL activation is:</p>
<ul>
<li>to increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC - online and IRL</li>
<li>to increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;</li>
<li>to invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO  community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,</li>
<li>to create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art and provides easy to digest information about Nouns for newcomers (plan is to expand to more cities)
<ul>
<li>high-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist’s explanation etc.</li>
<li>onboarding info about Nouns and how to get involved with the community</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nouns IRL - Person, Place, Thing</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to take the concept of a noun (person, place, thing) and apply it via art activations around the world with NYC being the first stop on the tour!</p>

(Jasper Wong)</p>
<p>Place</p>
<p>New York city during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.</p>
<p>We believe NFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.</p>
<p>Thing</p>
<p>Sharable handpainted mural art piece promoting NFT culture (optimized for social sharing on Twitter and Instagram), ice cream, meetup, and website</p>
<p>We have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For those in the know, the mural will act as a proverbial nod of acknowledgment to the projects that have made an impact and shed positive light on the crypto space in general. The goal is to create a compelling piece which shows unity within the crypto space and inspires the viewer to get involved.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide though art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artifact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images as well a timpelapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, etc. The website will also act as a user friendly hub of information for all things Nouns. From here, users will learn how to become involved with the Nouns DAO and branch out to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc.</p>
<p>We spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to deliver this activation which meant the proposal ended up being pretty long <img alt=":nerd_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/nerd_face.png?v=12" title=":nerd_face:" width="20"/> <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" width="20"/>. For those interested in reading the proposal in its entirety, please check out the following link: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMhrr5bnr7RQ0rknFXOQgeyP56easbzNZMND-QtMHys/edit" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns IRL - NYC Edition (draft) - Google Docs</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say NFT NYC is right around the corner so we are on a bit of a time crunch . We would love everyone’s thoughts on the proposal. We hope we can move forward and continue bringing amazing Nouns-related experiences to both the community as well as  newcomers to the project.</p>
<p>Thank you!!<br/>

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>We recevied some really good feedback from the Nouncil and a few other members from the community, we wanted to thank everyone for taking the time to give us their thoughts.</p>
<p>We’ve reduced the scope of our proposal to only include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3</a>), the mural will be viewable from June 20 - July 10 and will promote NFT culture by highlighting several well known projects with Nouns at the center</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple website/landing page to commemorate the mural</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ETH ask has been reduced to ~ 87.5 ETH.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional information about Jasper’s invovlement:</p>
<p>Jasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural’s flight time. Jasper is scheduled to be in NYC for the duration of NFT NYC and will make himself available to be present at the mural. Further, Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to make their way down to the completed mural to hang out with him. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends’ followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.</p>
<p><strong>Budget (all figures in USD):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mural Wall: $62,000.00:<br/>
A soft hold was placed on the mural location until the 27th of May; we are in communication with the mural company about extending the hold for at least another week. If we are able to keep the current location, the cost for the wall will be $36,000.00. The $62,000.00 amount is a rough quote for an alternate location. We are in communication with the company to determine if cheaper locations are available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artist: $40,000.00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team: $25,000.00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel/Accommodations: $6,000.00</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $144,000.00, total ETH ask: 87.5 ETH (based on $1,700.00 price of ETH as of May 27,2022; we have added 2.5 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees).</p>
<p>We are really excited at the potential of making this a reality and hope that this can be the first stop of a worldwide Nouns street Art tour!!!</p>
<p>Thank you!!<br/>

<p>Hey Doowoop,<br/>
so the wall price is 36k but in case the decision-making takes too long, you might have to switch to a more expensive wall (62k)? What does the “team” expense mean?</p>

<p>Hey Maty,</p>
<p>That’s correct. We had initially recieved a quote for 2 wall locations, the second one being $62,000.00 which is why we’ve listed that amount for the time being. The intention is to ensure that any substitute locations will cost as little as possible but given that NFT NYC is around the corner, the demand for walls may exceed the supply so we may end up paying closer to the $62,000.00 amount. We should have more clarity surrounding the wall this week. I will provide an update once received, at which point I will adjust the ask for the wall accordingly.</p>
<p>The team amount is what we have allocated for compensation. This covers planning, providing support to the artist where necessary, being present at the mural for a portion of the time after completion to answer questions, finalizing content for the website, etc.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto"># Nouns IRL World Art Tour - NYC Mural
By Nouns Collective

![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/fJ9nndG.png)
_(Microsoft Surface Mural, Jasper Wong)_

## TL;DR
Let’s bring Nouns to the world through a global art tour starting with Nouns IRL in NYC! This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 – 23) and will feature:
- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 – July 10 and will promote NFT culture by highlighting several well known projects with Nouns at the center.
- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural

**The activation is estimated to generate ~2.5M impressions. The total amount being requested is 87.5 ETH.**

## Why Should You Care? 
We can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: 
- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC—online and IRL
- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;
- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,
- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)
  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist’s explanation etc.
  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  

## Nouns IRL — Person, Place, Thing
Nouns: person, place, thing… We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people’s faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. 

## Person
Jasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).

Jasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast’s 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.

Jasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural’s flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends’ followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.

Jasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others.

## Place
New York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.

NFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.

## Thing
Sharable hand painted mural art piece promoting NFT culture (optimised for social sharing on Twitter and Instagram) and website.

We have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For those in the know, the mural will act as a proverbial nod of acknowledgment to the projects that have made an impact and have shed a positive light on the crypto space in general. The mural will showcase popular CC0 and non-CC0 projects such as BAYC, Doodles, Moonbirds, Cryptoads, Chain Runners, CryptoPunks, Coolcats, World of Women, Creature World, DeadFellaz, Okay Bears, etc. Each of these projects have extremely large and very loyal followings which we believe will ensure that the mural reaches the widest audience possible. The goal is to create a compelling piece which shows unity within the crypto space and inspires the viewer to get involved. 

![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)

The mural will be located at 300 W Broadway, next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8’9” H x 16’ W in size.

As mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. 

## Budget (all figures are in USD):
- Mural Wall: $62,000.00:
A soft hold was placed on the mural location until the 27th of May; we are in communication with the mural company about extending the hold for at least another week. If we are able to keep the current location, the cost for the wall will be $36,000.00. The $62,000.00 amount is a rough quote for an alternate location. We are in communication with the wall company to determine if cheaper locations are available. We are more than willing to return any funds that we did not end up needing to use to secure the wall.
- Artist: $40,000.00
- Team: $25,000.00
- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00
- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00

**Total: $144,000.00, total ETH ask: 87.5 ETH**
_Based on $1,700.00 price of ETH as of May 27, 2022; we have added 2.5 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._

## Team
This activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. 

For this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.

## To be Nountinued…

We are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement. We hope that this stop on the tour will be the first of many to come!

<p>Just chiming in since i was sponsoring this prop until skilift took over.</p>
<p>I agree with this and had a chat with doowop about it as part of the sponsor process. However the team on their side was adamant about letting Jasper (the artist) stay in control and thought it be a better fit for the audience, as I understood it.</p>
<p>I expect this to be a point of concern for the DAO but ultimately thought its something we should be voting on. After pointing out that this might be a tough pill to swallow, I did not feel confident enough to strongarm doowop/the team into changing their plan.</p>

<p>Hey Noun22,</p>
<p>I’ll respond to this and the previous comment here.</p>
<p>As far as we know, the wall location referenced in the proposal is still on hold. We are waiting for the wall company to advise us otherwise. We have also requested information on alternate locations and will provide details of our choice for a substitue if necessary and as soon as the information is available. The company is working with us to make this happen but utlimatley we will have to make a payment to be 100% assured that the location is secured. We are more than willing to work with the DAO to arrive at a solution. Are there some contingencies that can be put in place to reassure the DAO in this scenario?</p>

<p>The compensation covers planning, providing support to the artist where necessary, being present at the mural for a portion of the time after completion to answer questions, finalizing content for the website, etc. The team consists of a few members from our main Nouns Collective core and Ms. Singh.

<ul>
<li>i appreciate giving Jasper the creative freedom and control to do whatever he wants, but it is not in Nouns DAO’s interest to be the sole sponsor of a mural where there are 20+ other NFT projects.  it sounds like a great mural and Jasper is a great artist, but if it’s going to be a big blend of NFTs then i think you should get all the different communities to individually crowdfund a portion of the mural.  from speaking to the DAO, there is a consensus that this issue is a dealbreaker</li>
<li>it sounds like you don’t actually know if the wall is still on hold? or if it will still be on hold in 7+ days when voting is over?  or where any alternate locations might be?  this is really basic information that you should have for us before you ask us to send you $144,000</li>

<p>Hey Noun 22,</p>
<p>Both the main and updated posts mentioned that the mural would feature multiple projects.</p>
<p>“the mural will be viewable from June 20 - July 10 and will promote NFT culture by highlighting several well known projects with Nouns at the center”</p>
<p>Given that NFT NYC is such a high density event, we figured that the mural would cut through the noise by taking a more inclusive approach. Our hypothesis was that including multiple projects would attract more attention to the mural IRL and URL. Further, we wanted to give Jasper the freedom to express himself with the piece but we did advise him that Nouns should be the central focus. In general, we figured that shedding light on the crypto/NFT scene as a whole was a pretty Nounish thing to do (especially at NFT NYC) considering that Nouns is built on the priniciples of CC0, openeness, and inclusion.</p>
<p>At one point we were toying with the idea of putting Noggles on all of the characters in the mural. Would this be a good middle ground? A possible drawback with this is that it may cause a bit of a backlash from the other projects as this isn’t how those characters usually look. The mural has not yet been finalized so we will definitley have another internal discussion with Jasper and the team about this.</p>

_(Microsoft Surface Mural, Jasper Wong)_

## TL;DR
Let’s bring Nouns to the world through a global art tour starting with Nouns IRL in NYC! This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 – 23) and will feature:
- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 – July 10 and will feature Nouns in all their glory.
- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural

**The activation is estimated to generate ~1.7M impressions. The total amount being requested is 72.5 ETH.**

## Why Should You Care? 
We can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: 
- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC—online and IRL
- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;
- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,
- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)
  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist’s explanation etc.
  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  

## Nouns IRL — Person, Place, Thing
Nouns: person, place, thing… We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people’s faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. 

## Person
Jasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).

Jasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast’s 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.

Jasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural’s flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends’ followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.

Jasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others.

## Place
New York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.

NFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.

## Thing
Sharable hand painted mural art piece promoting Nouns and a simple website.

We have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For the more experienced, the mural will act as an introduction to Nouns; we hope that it shows them the many possibilities of being involved with the DAO. The overall goal is to create a compelling piece which introduces Nouns to the viewer and inspires the viewer to get involved.

The mural will be located at 300 W Broadway (next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8’9” H x 16’ W in size.

As mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. 

## Budget (all figures are in USD):
- Mural Wall: $36,000.00:
We have been advised by the wall company that a soft hold will be placed on the mural location for us at least until the 10th of June.
- Artist: $40,000.00
- Team: $25,000.00
- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00
- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00

**Total: $118,000.00, total ETH ask: 72.5 ETH**
_Based on $1,700.00 price of ETH as of June 3, 2022; we have added ~3 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._

## Team
This activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. 

For this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.

## To be Nountinued…

We are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement. We hope that this stop on the tour will be the first of many to come!

<p>Quick update.</p>
<p>Jasper sent over his vision for the mural art. Wanted to share with everyone to give a preivew of what to expect. I’ve also attached an image of one of his completed murals so everyone can get a sense of the finished piece as well.</p>
