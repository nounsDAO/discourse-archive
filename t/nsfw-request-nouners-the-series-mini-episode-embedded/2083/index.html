<p>GM Frens,</p>
<p>Rekola Here. As someone who loves the nouns community and proliferating the meme (I created <a href="/t/nsfw-request-nouners-the-series-mini-episode-embedded/2083">Noun Dust</a>), my day job is actually as an executive producer of independent feature films, tv shows, and web series.</p>
<p>So my team and I took a long weekend to make a mini demo of an animated series we call Nouners - The Series. Now, we’re asking NSFW to fund our pilot which can be completed in four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Our ultimate goal is to create a fun, irreverent, series that is cost-efficent, and above all quality. Ask is $15004 in USD to create the pilot, a 10 minute episode.</strong> <strong>See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcLF0LJOb_o" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">animatic here</a>, or below</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOUNERS - THE SERIES</strong><br/>
Concept - When a group of <a href="http://Nouns.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns.wtf</a> NFTs become sentient and self aware in an alien world known as the internet, they must learn to survive while tackling the existential mysteries of the universe in the stupidest ways possible. Watch them grow and learn, all while repeating the same idiotic mistakes that mankind has been making for centuries!</p>
<p>Segments will run 3-3:30 minutes, with 3 segments making up a traditional episode. This flexibility lets segments stand on their own or compile into longer form episodes.</p>
<p><strong>PROOF OF CONCEPT:</strong><br/>
A one minute proof of concept video was created to give you a sense of animation and tone. Existing Nouns were used to give a sense of movement and function, but from here additional story and humor will be injected with even more Nouns to come!</p>
<p>Embedded below is our demo. Click to watch.</p>

</a>
</div>
<p><strong>SAMPLE STORYLINES</strong><br/>
“The Birth Of Assholes” – while one Nouner discovers the beach and tries to figure out where one is supposed to go to the bathroom in such a magical place, another Nouner learns that it’s okay to express negative thoughts, leading to them becoming the world’s very first…critic!</p>
<p>“The Birth of Religion” – While one Nouner experiments with the powers of the internet and learns that they can create anything at will, another Nouner becomes increasingly paranoid about what happens to the Nouners when they go to sleep or the technology turns off. In the end they end up competing feuding religions and going to war with one another.</p>
<p>“The Birth of Family” – When a new Nouner appears from nowhere, unaware of the rules of Nouner society, they begin asking difficult questions about their identities that no one has the answers to – like why is a Taco-person and animal people and cool guys with sunglasses all created equal in Nouner land? In the end, the Nouners create separate teams called families.</p>
<p><strong>SERIES COMPARISONS:</strong><br/>
Marcel the Shell, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Bojack Horseman, and the works of Mel Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>OUR CHARACTERS</strong><br/>
As Nouns don’t come with an inherent mythology or personality type, we are going to apply basic personality types to characters as we move forward so that characters start to become known for their archetypes. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Optimistic</li>
<li>The Alpha</li>
<li>The Pushover</li>
<li>The Neurotic</li>
<li>The Easygoing</li>
<li>The Intellectual</li>
</ul>
<p>By using these characters as needed per their personality type, it will give the audience a sense of stability and recognition when a character appears on screen that usually takes more structured storytelling to create.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE DO WE GO?</strong><br/>
PHASE 1</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of Nouners Pilot (est. 30 days to completion)</li>
<li>Begin Promoting/Raising Awareness of Nouners with social media and grassroots marketing via twitter spaces weekly hosting about our progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>PHASE 2</p>
<ul>
<li>Sale/Distribution of Pilot based on longterm production goals with candidates including Snapchat, Youtube</li>
<li>Greenlight to complete Season 1 w/additional episodes</li>
</ul>
<p>PHASE 3</p>
<ul>
<li>As more Nouners content is created, including spin-offs, we would like to create a more branded and exclusive home for <a href="http://Nouns.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns.wtf</a> content that allows other members to contribute, such as an exclusive app or VOD platform. This allows for larger creative freedom and profitability for <a href="http://Nouns.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns.wtf</a> and it’s creative partners.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BENEFITS TO NOUNS:</strong><br/>
Our team sees the advantage of Nouners as multi-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>With our fast production time and industry relations, our series can hit the market faster than typical animation or creative projects being reviewed right now.</li>
<li>The release of the pilot and continued episodes will naturally proliferate the Nouns brand while still giving quality storytelling elements to attract an audience.</li>
<li>By relying on the Nouns Design standards - we plan to create a few new Noun Head Traits that we will provide to the DAO for voting for future inclusion into auctions. If included, this may increase future auction prices if these character traits gain notoriety and are minted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FUNDING REQUEST - $15,004</strong><br/>

<p>Approved!</p>
<p>I am very excited to fund this request.  You have been doing a great job so far as a contributor - first Nouns Dust, and now this.  I love that you guys were able to deliver an animatic as a part of this proposal.  I think the tone is differentiated and it will be interesting to see the trailer and if it is as memeticaly resonant as I believe it has the potential to be.  The cost is also extremely reasonable.  Please keep us posted on your progress and thanks again for building on Nouns</p>
<p>I would urge all other creators of short form animated content to use this as a model</p>
