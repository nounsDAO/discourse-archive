<p>People | Nouns | T-shirts | Coffee</p>
<p>We want to launch a stamp-collection-loyalty program with 10+ authentic coffee shops. When a customer buys a coffee cup he/she will receive one stamp. When a customer collects 10 stamps he/she can exchange a coupon card for a free nounish t-shirt or a nouns branded drip-bag coffee. The goal of this proposal is to create a sustainable proliferation machine in the form of Nouns Coffee and T-shirt brands.</p>

<p>A cool collaboration where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nouns would provide t-shirts and drip-bag coffee</li>
<li>Coffee shops provide access to popular locations and distribution channels</li>
<li>Nouns would get visibility and continuous proliferation</li>
<li>Coffee shops get more sales, more customers, and more competitive hence even better proliferation location</li>
</ul>
<p>After the loyalty program, we will sell drip-bag coffee and pay a royalty from each sale to the coffee shops.<br/>
The earned money will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>compensate work of the team</li>
<li>make project self-sustaining</li>
<li>slowly expand to other geographical locations (Japan, and Singapore)</li>
<li>payback to NounsDAO by acquiring some nouns (hopefully in a year)</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#details-2" name="details-2"></a>Details</h3>
<p>We put together a very korean way to promote NounsDAO. We want to launch a stamp-collection-loyalty program with 20+ authentic coffee shops. When a customer buys a coffee cup he/she will receive one stamp. When a customer collects 10 stamps he/she can exchange a coupon card for a free nounish t-shirt or a noun’s branded drip-bag coffee.<br/>
The goal of this proposal is to create a sustainable proliferation machine in the form of Nouns Coffee and T-shirt brands. Stamp-collection-loyalty program is a tool that would help quickly create visibility and promote Nouns in a short period of time. After the loyalty program we would offer to coffee shops to continue working with us and sell nouns drip-bag-coffee. We are going to pay a royalty fee from each sale. This would create a unique distribution channel. The coffee shops would be able to make extra money. The NounsDAO would get constant visibility at 10+ coffee shops.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#t-shirts-5" name="t-shirts-5"></a>T-shirts</h3>
<p>First, we want to create high-quality 100% cotton nounish t-shirts. We are planning to design around ten different t-shirt designs that would appeal to different demographics. About 2,000 t-shirts will be manufactured and available for free via a stamp-collection-loyalty program at 20+ coffee shops. Each time a customer buys a coffee he will get a noggles-stamp on a card. A coupon card with 10 stamps can be exchanged for a free nounish t-shirt or a drip-bag coffee.<br/>

<p>Drip-bag coffee is the best coffee when you consider preparation time and freshness and will attract a lot of loyal customers. We want to roast two types of coffee: a classic black coffee and a vanilla flavored coffee. The coffee will be packed into a drip-bag filters and the whole package will feature noun head-traits for example an ape with red noggles.

<p>We want to partner with small coffee shops around Korea and give them access to run a stamp-collection-loyalty program. The authentic coffee shops would be able to use a loyalty program to attract more customers and compete with franchise coffee shops. We are going to set a display with t-shirts and drip-bag coffee. People will be able to check the quality of t-shirts while waiting for coffee and get one right at the counter after collecting enough stamps. After the end of loyalty program we will keep selling drip-bag coffee at coffee shops and pay a royalty from each sale.</p>

<p>interesting idea! have you already discussed with coffee shops interested in participating?</p>
<p>If $30,000 is minimum operation cost for 6 months, are these costs + the t shirts, ect need to be repeat costs to continue? Any thoughts or discussion on collaboration with existing nouns coffee?</p>

<p>Thanks for comments.</p>
<p>T-shirts and coffee are two most simple items that everyone consumes. You can make really cool t-shirts and very delicious coffee that stands out on the shelves with small investments.</p>
<p>Our vision is to make a sustainable business but we need that first push to be on everyone’s radar. We have a three coffee shops owned by friends that would run the loyalty program first. We do want to give coffee shops access to t-shirts and drip bag coffee. We do not want to pay coffee shops to run a loyalty program because once you pay the whole concept won’t be sustainable. We believe we can make t-shirts that everyone loves. We want coffee shops to come to us by offering them items to attract customers and make extra money. It might be difficult at first but we believe will get there. We start with first three coffee shops and use it as an example to bring another seven. Ten locations would put us on radar and we will be able to create enough buzz on sns.</p>
<p>At first, there will be a lot of leg work. Someone needs to sign the coffee shops. We need to place some paper work. A 100 t-shirts weight around 23 kg, moving t-shirts and coffee around would require us to use some services.</p>
<p>After 6 months, we will sell t-shirts and coffee online that would reduce operational cost and help us to earn money.</p>
<p>The value here is that Nouns logos will be at 10 locations for 6 months. We also hope that it could attract other famous brand to launch similar loyalty programs with us. Then we have an opportunity to display nouns t-shirts next to products of other brands. That also would be interesting proliferation model.</p>

<p>Hi, fiveoceans_dev<br/>
I like this idea ”Coffee and Tshits" very much.  But I feel that  the runnig cost and starting cost for dripping bag brand is too big and expensive. If I do same plan, I would probably set the price under $100,000. I think that after reviewing the budget, the proposal would be more satisfactory.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by! The team set a goal to establish a sustainable proliferation model for Nouns by bringing to market nounish t-shirts and coffee. We feel it doesn’t make sense to run a campaign only for a specific period of time… It is much better to invest money into something that would last years. $170,000  is a lot of money but brings visibility at many locations and would allow us to scale globally. We actually think our next country would be Japan where we can create visibility for Nouns with same t-shirts and coffee.</p>

<p>Updates. We reduced Basic operational cost to $10,000</p>
<p>The goal of the team is to establish a self-sufficient way to produce nounish t-shirts and coffee hence we must be able to achieve this goal without asking for support from NounsDAO.</p>

<p>I think that it is fair to say that there needs to be a better understanding that every single one of these projects is a promotional effort to build awareness about nouns and that has a cost associated with it. To expect builders to be self sustaining when there is still no awareness is an unrealistic goal this early. perhaps a two year roadmap to this is more realistic ? I think that the products you made compliment your prop perfectly</p>
