<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#tldr-2" name="tldr-2"></a>TL;DR</h2>
<p>This proposal brings much-needed TLC to the Nouns gateway - the Auction Site. <a href="http://Nouns.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns.wtf</a> has various deprecated components on the brink of being phased out, risking the site’s functionality. By revamping the nouns-webapp codebase, addressing outdated dependencies, enhancing chain calls handling, and implementing various fixes and optimizations, I aim to breathe new life into the platform. This overhaul will not only improve performance and streamline development, but also help onboard more developers and better retain existing contributors, ensuring consistency and quality among derivative projects while captivating and engaging even non-technical users.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#summary-3" name="summary-3"></a>Summary</h3>
<p>This tech-focused proposal aims to enhance the performance, accessibility, and functionality of the Nouns Monorepo, paving the way for a more efficient and user-friendly platform.</p>
<p>As Nounish builders, we strive to make our core codebase the gold standard, enabling easier custom fork creation and facilitating the growth of Nounish projects. This not only serves the Nouns Flywheel but also fosters positive externalities, educating people about Nouns and crypto in general.</p>
<p>Through a series of optimizations and fixes, this proposal intends to improve chain call handling, performance, documentation, and implement new features like a robust caching system to minimize network traffic. These improvements will lead to a better user experience, attract new contributors, and ensure consistency and quality among derivative projects, all while recognizing and building upon the hard work of existing contributors.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#background-4" name="background-4"></a>Background</h3>
<p>The Nouns Monorepo is an ecosystem comprising of smart contracts and SDKs that support the development of Nouns distributed applications. It includes the primary <a href="http://nouns.wtf">nouns.wtf</a> site.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#the-problem-5" name="the-problem-5"></a>The Problem</h3>
<p>The current site’s dependencies, including the wallet and chain interaction library web3-react (v6.1.9), are outdated, with some being two years old. To enhance accessibility and performance, the site needs optimization in chain call handling, bug fixes, and UI improvements. For example, implementing a caching system will limit surplus RPC calls, improving network efficiency and allowing better utilization of public resources. This change eases pressure on users’ systems and aids future builders, representing just one of the many fixes implimented.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#the-solution-6" name="the-solution-6"></a>The Solution</h3>
<p>To unlock the full potential of the Nouns gateway, I’ve taken a deep dive into the nouns-webapp codebase, addressing outdated dependencies and fine-tuning it with valuable optimizations. This provides a seamless and enjoyable experience for users of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>To improve blockchain interactions, I’ve focused on performance enhancements that lead to quicker load times and a smoother user experience. I’ve also introduced a smart caching system to minimize network traffic, making the site more efficient and reducing the burden on users’ systems.</p>
<p>To make the development process more efficient and attract new contributors, I’ve improved documentation, streamlined dev onboarding. This leads to a more accessible platform that retains the talents of existing contributors while captivating newcomers.</p>
<p>In summary, this proposal upgrades result in an improved user experience, attract fresh talent, and ensure that the Nouns Monorepo remains a standout platform among its peers. By building upon the hard work of our existing contributors, we elevate the Nouns ecosystem to new heights, fostering growth and prosperity for the entire community.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#my-story-7" name="my-story-7"></a>My Story</h3>
<p>Initially, my goal was to set up a development testbed for a Nouns app project. However, the complexity of setting up the simnet and site led me to identify opportunities for improving the Nouns Monorepo ecosystem. I observed that aside from the original builders, few people were contributing to the main site/contracts, despite many derivative projects making improvements. I realized there was a lack of upstream feedback and some dependencies, like web3-react, were outdated.</p>
<p>My motivation shifted to optimizing the Nouns Monorepo by addressing its current issues, providing a better user experience, facilitating onboarding for new contributors, and ensuring consistency and quality among derivative projects. What initially began as a small project to update the site to support web3-react v8 beta and create a tutorial evolved into a comprehensive effort to enhance the ecosystem.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, I undertook various tasks, including updating dependencies, improving code performance and testing, adding new features, and enhancing documentation. Through these efforts, I aimed to create a more accessible and robust Nouns ecosystem that encourages collaboration and contributions from the community.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#inspiration-and-vision-8" name="inspiration-and-vision-8"></a>Inspiration and Vision</h3>
<p>Encountering difficulties while setting up a development testbed for a Nouns app project inspired me to propose improvements to the Nouns Monorepo Dev Experience. I realized opportunities existed to improve the ecosystem and make it more accessible for developers.</p>
<p>My vision is to optimize the Nouns Monorepo by addressing its current issues, providing a better user experience, facilitating onboarding for new contributors, and ensuring consistency and quality among derivative projects. Through updating dependencies, improving code performance and testing, adding new features, and enhancing documentation, I aim to attract more developers to contribute to the main site/contracts and derivative projects, leading to a more vibrant ecosystem with better functionality and user experience. This will also make it easier for new contributors to onboard and improve the ecosystem’s overall quality.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#challenges-and-opportunities-9" name="challenges-and-opportunities-9"></a>Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
<p>The DAO aims to create an inclusive and accessible ecosystem for developers to contribute to its growth. However, current pain points and issues hinder onboarding new contributors and impede the ecosystem’s progress.</p>
<p>Outdated dependencies and insufficient documentation create friction for new contributors, causing delays in the development process and limiting the ecosystem’s growth potential. Moreover, the lack of upstream feedback from derivative projects built from the Nouns Monorepo results in a disconnect between the main site/contracts and the broader ecosystem, leading to a less cohesive and less efficient ecosystem.</p>
<p>These issues also impact the DAO’s operations, making it difficult to implement changes and updates to the current site/contracts.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#conclusion-10" name="conclusion-10"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In conclusion, optimizing the Nouns Monorepo will lead to improved performance, easier development, and better contributions from the community. It will also ensure consistency and quality among derivatives and projects built using the monorepo.</p>
