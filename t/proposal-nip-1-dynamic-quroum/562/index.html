<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#simple-summary-2" name="simple-summary-2"></a>Simple Summary</h2>
<p>A dynamic quorum that adjusts as a function of for/against votes, allowing uncontested proposals to pass at a minimum defined quorum, while requiring higher assurance on contested proposals.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#abstract-3" name="abstract-3"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p>This NIP proposes an update to the <code>NounsDAOLogicV1</code> contract that replaces the static <code>proposal.quorumVotes</code> with a dynamic quorum that adjusts based on the amount of opposition.</p>
<p>TODO: Decide on curve (linear, exponential, etc.)</p>
<p>Sample Quorum Calculation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">x = for_votes / (for_votes + against_votes)
if (x &lt;= 0.5) {
    return failed
}

min_quorum_bps = 1000
max_quorum_bps = 5000
quorum_bps = ((max_quorum_bps - min_quorum_bps) * (1 - x)) + min_quorum_bps
quorum = (quorum_bps * total_supply) / 10000

return for_votes &gt;= quorum
</code></pre>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#motivation-4" name="motivation-4"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>This is a step towards decentralization, offering improved security and partial mitigation of risks associated with vote accumulation by individual members, while keeping friction low for routine governance tasks.</p>
<p>A dynamic quorum integrates some aspects of optimistic governance (low friction on uncontroversial or ‘procedural’ proposals) by allowing uncontested proposals to pass at the current 10% quorum, while requiring higher assurance on contested proposals as a function of turnout/dissent.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>[Note: min_quorum_bps + max_quorum_bps &lt;= 10000]</p>
<p>using  above function gives the following quorum minimums at given consensus thresholds-<br/>
(Consensus, Quorum) : (100%, 10%), (75%, 20%), (50%, 30%)</p>
<p>(consensus = for votes / (for + against votes)</p>

<p>thanks for sharing this. nounders had a preliminary discussion about it this morning, and our main feedback is that we think all governance protocol changes should undergo a formal audit before being executed. so 100% we should explore, model, and debate the cryptoeconomic consequences of this kind of change, and intuitively it is an interesting and probably good idea, but before thinking about putting it on-chain it will require a substantial amount of diligence. just want to make clear to everyone that even though it might look the same, this is not the same flavor of proposal as funding a coloring book etc. due to the long tail catastrophic risks of getting it wrong. solimander also mentioned that it might be a good first use-case for the proposal diligence committee</p>

<p>thx 4156- reiterating from discord that I agree wholeheartedly with all of this and that I hope we can work out an efficient, conscientious paradigm for updating contracts.</p>
