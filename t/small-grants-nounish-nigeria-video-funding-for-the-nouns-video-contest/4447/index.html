<p><strong>What Is The Project?</strong><br/>
The Project entails creating a very Nounish Video that blends the diverse Nigerian Culture with many Elements of the NounsDAO, specifically the idea behind funding creative &amp; useful ideas and also simply making hundreds of Nigerians fall in love with the Noggles.</p>
<p>The Video is supposed to serve as an entry into the $200,000 Nouns Video Contest Ending in 8 days. I already drafted a video script and planned out the entire video with a friend who is a Videographer several weeks ago. But I had been waiting on payments for several jobs I did in March for exchanges like <a href="http://Gate.io" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gate.io</a> and projects like EDNS Domains. April is about ending and I have not received a dime yet so Iâ€™m very short on funds to carry out this project.</p>
<p>I just completed my university education so I donâ€™t have a strong enough credit score or a functional business to get a sufficient loan here in Nigeria. My friends are equally fresh graduates so we all just simply donâ€™t have enough funds to pull together for this. I tried getting some funding during the Nouns Video Contest Promotional Proposal but I didnâ€™t get selected.</p>
<p><strong>Under the shower this morning, I realized NounsDAO was literally a platform to fund ideas and after some research, I found myself here</strong></p>
<p><strong>How it will proliferate Nouns?</strong><br/>
Nigeria is a talented nation filled with lots of hidden talent which only needs a platform to help them express themselves. So many ideas are being funded in the European and American regions and Africa equally has a strong potential to be a fan favorite in the Nouns Community.</p>
<p>If Iâ€™m able to make this video, thereâ€™d already be a lot of exposure here in the economic powerhouse of the nation, Lagos. Interest in NounsDAO will increase and the adoption of Blockchain as a whole will take a deeper rooting in this continent. All because of NounsDAO.</p>
<p>Secondly, seeing a lot of Africans wearing Noggles is just going to be Super Awesome.</p>
<p><strong>How much upfront funding do you want?</strong><br/>
Iâ€™m looking for 1.2ETH or $2,000 worth of funding for this project. It will cover the cost of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Training a zoo monkey to wear Noggles and do some flips for the video</li>
<li>Shooting the video, renting out the equipment, space and paying people that will be part of the video cast</li>
<li>Printing high-quality educational brochures to educate people who might be curious about the Noggles people are wearing.</li>
<li>Promotional efforts in the form of Billboards and Social Media Marketing (YouTube Ads, Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads).</li>
</ol>
<p>The contest is ending in 8 days and I had been so pumped to make the video weeks ago and hopefully win and donate a part of the winnings to a very useful charity. Iâ€™m hoping NounsDAO will come in Clutch with the save and assist with this funding. Iâ€™d be eternally grateful.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™ve just learned that Ads are out of the question when it comes to organic views. Going to scrap that then.</p>

<p>Best of luck to you guys! I would say to just go for it and get anything you can out in video form in the next 2 days and share it like crazy. You only need to retain 30 seconds of someoneâ€™s time and people can rewatch 4-5 times per day so get creative and submit something!</p>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@ROTEX</span>, I think videos that have received funding are automatically disqualified from the contest, but I suggest you double-check that with the team behind it.</p>
