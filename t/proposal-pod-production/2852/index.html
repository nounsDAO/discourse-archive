<p>Noun O’ Talk is the OG Nouns podcast with the most episodes and highest quality content. cdt regularly interviews a range of notable guests from the Nouns community and web3 more broadly, bringing visibility to Nouns and leveraging guests’ network effect. Nouns DAO should fund the production of Noun O’ Talk to enable cdt to focus on his main work while increasing the production quality, visibility, and reach of the podcast.</p>

<p>For an average podcast of 108 downloads per episode - I do not believe $1600 per editing of an episode is worth while - also the per episode model incentivises pumping out podcasts instead of quantity &gt; quality</p>

<p>Thank you for the support <span class="mention">@SuperTightWoody</span>! It means a lot.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, that’s correct <span class="mention">@Sam</span>. We wanted to provide a couple options and get feedback from the community before going on-chain. If you have thoughts on either direction, please let us know.</p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback <span class="mention">@eojjim</span>! Recent episodes (ep18 onwards) are averaging ~ 200 downloads, so nearly twice the figure you mentioned. Initial cross-posting to TikTok was also very promising with an average of 800+ views per clip, which is why we think this approach (podcast + YouTube/TikTok) is ideal for maximizing the reach of each episode.</p>
<p>In terms of quantity vs. quality, we have high standards and each episode that we’ve produced has been very high quality. There is a lot of labour that goes into each episode and the final results reflect this. We’re confident that we can maintain a high level of quality while following a consistent publishing schedule.</p>
