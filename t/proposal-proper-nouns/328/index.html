<p>Proper Nouns is a PFP project that is a derivative of Nouns. While a Noun is usually a thing (burger <img alt=":hamburger:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/hamburger.png?v=12" title=":hamburger:" width="20"/>) or animal (panda <img alt=":panda_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/panda_face.png?v=12" title=":panda_face:" width="20"/>), Proper Nouns are unique people. <img alt=":man:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man.png?v=12" title=":man:" width="20"/> <img alt=":woman:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/woman.png?v=12" title=":woman:" width="20"/> Proper Nouns are for everyone. Since Proper Nouns are unique individuals, they should also have a unique look and personality. We’ve taken all the original nouns bodies and accessories, and have created a lot of new ones. We’re also going to be introducing new traits to the layering system. (Skin color / mouth / hair and head accessories / extras / new backgrounds)</p>

<ul>
<li>The owner of the Proper Noun will be able to name their noun on-chain. This ties in with the “Proper Noun” name of the project.</li>
<li>Just like Nouns, Proper Nouns will be fully on-chain. No off-chain or IPFS links.</li>
<li>Proper Nouns artwork will be CC0, in the spirit on Nouns.</li>
<li>There will be 500+ traits for Proper Nouns (162 are original Noun traits from body and accessories, so over 350 new and unique traits.) This allows the characters to not have too much repetitiveness when they are generated. There will also be different rarity levels to some of the traits. For instance, Noun Head Accessories will be more rare.<br/>

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#minting-and-supply-details-3" name="minting-and-supply-details-3"></a>Minting and Supply Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>8888 Proper Nouns</strong> - We think the large number allows for a lot of people to be part of the Proper Nouns community. The more people who own Proper Nouns, the more people will have their PFPs on Twitter be a Proper Noun with Nouns glasses. We also think with the larger amount of holders, it’s easier to justify / incentivize building on top of Proper Nouns and Nouns. (Also the Nouns were launched on 8/8 so we like that number.)</li>
<li><strong>.033 minting cost</strong> - We wanted to keep it relatively low so hopefully cost won’t be an issue for people. Also considering how expensive gas has been recently.</li>
<li>All noun holders will be able to mint <strong>5 Proper Nouns</strong> for free.</li>
<li><strong>88 Proper Nouns</strong> will be reserved for the founding team. Marketing and giveaways will also come from this amount.</li>

<p>Hey Jad. Thank you for taking the time to craft out this proposal. I like the artwork and concept, it shows you guys have put in time to think through the project. Personally, I’d love to see this come alive. A new Nounish community is a good thing for the Nouns.</p>
<p>As expressed via dms, I do have concerns wrt Nouns DAO funding a PFP project in that these projects tend to pump and fizzle out quickly simply because that is how the market behaves. Given the relative low funding cost, I’d love to hear from other Nouners to see if that matters at all.</p>
<p>I’d be excited to see this proposal as a “grant to start a Nounish state” of sorts. Instead of the funds going back to the DAO, have it go to the community treasury. Something like 70% for the treasury and 30% for the founders seems reasonable. All this to create something that is more likely to self-select for a community who’s interested in the long term. I totally understand if that’s out of the question though since it would potentially mean a wholly different project.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@seneca</span> Thanks for your response. I do understand your sentiment with a lot of PFP projects just fizzling out, and while we can’t promise that ours won’t follow what happened to other big projects, we can say that we are dedicated on working on this project and building this community and want to see it succeed long term. We really want Proper Nouns to be a way for people to feel ownership and participate in the Nouns community. and giving them a person/identity through our PFP is a great way to do it.</p>
<p>Just to make sure I understand, when you say to split the proceeds 30/70 between founders and community treasury, are you referring to a Proper Nouns community treasury? So essentially a new DAO formed by Proper Nouns? But with a different mission as to what we’ve seen other DAOs who have formed through Nouns do?</p>

<p>yep, that’s what I was suggesting. Turning Proper Nouns into a full fledged community with a treasury  and governance. With the potential 300 ETH raised, Proper Nouns could buy their own Noun, participate in governance and propose new projects. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a different mission, just another space and direction for the Nouns community to grow with.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@cryptoseneca</span> we talked it over as a team, and we like the DAO concept a lot, but forming a DAO isn’t something that we have experience with, and we have some concerns about the potential legal implications. We’re not completely ruling out the idea, but as a team of artists and developers, we’re primarily interested in creating art around Nouns, and building a community around that.</p>
<p>We do think there are some unique things that this project can do around connecting people together to build around Nouns:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Proper Nouns PFP offers people a sense of ownership and identity in the nouns ecosystem. Owners can name their Proper Nouns, have a fun bio, and be able to share their Twitter/Discord</li>
<li>This directory can be a source for our community to connect with others. We can have badges/filters of different types of builders: artists/developer/writers/video/etc</li>
</ol>
<p>I think maybe once a community is formed we’ll have a better understanding of what the community wants, and we can self-organize from there.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@snape0x</span> as far as minting goes, these are some of the mechanics we’ve been considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 free for the noun owners (if they claim all, that’s 500+)</li>
<li>Allowlist — we approve wallets before the mint. Not sure yet about the exact mechanism that we’d use, we’ve been studying how other large projects have been doing it. We’ve seen some projects using tokens as “mint passes”</li>
<li>Possibly a dutch auction for the remaining supply. Start at .33eth and reduce by .03 every 10 minutes. We’ve seen other launches recently have success with this method</li>
<li>Have a limit of N (10?) mints per wallet</li>

One thing that I just thought of with the retro-grants fund would be we wouldn’t be able to have our own channel under <em>Projects</em> where we can ask for more feedback/give updates to the current state of Proper Nouns. Probably not a big deal, we can always just seek for feedback/get help under <span class="hashtag">#artists</span> or <span class="hashtag">#developers</span>.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@jad</span> I like your thinking around minting mechanics and we could definitely brainstorm more around those. You could consider whitelisting the NounsDAO (active) discord members in a way that prevents bots or spam. It’s a natural pool of dedicated users who expressed interest in Nouns but were otherwise priced out. In any case, it would be “nounish” to innovate around the distribution method.</p>
<p>Regarding naming functionality have you thought about leveraging ENS vs developing it internally? ENS is shaping up to be a web3 social graph with names, avatars etc. My hunch is that plugging into the ENS ecosystem could be a cool avenue to explore. But it’s your call at the end of the day. Disclosure: I’m a big ENS fan, airdrop recipient and own several .eth domains.</p>
<p>Happy to take your proposal on-chain if other nowners feel it’s the best way to proceed. <span class="mention">@seneca</span> had some ideas about small grants fund as well. Let’s wait for his feedback but I’d love to see this happen one way or another.</p>

<p>Hey guys.  I love this project’s art style.  Thank you for taking the time to make an engaging and well thought out proposal!  I am a member of the Nouns Small Grants and Retro Funding group, and this is the type of thing I think we would look to compensate you on for your efforts and contribution to the ecosystem.  I am hugely supportive of all derivatives projects and Small Grants has given ETH (in lesser amounts) to projects before.</p>
<p>However, in the proposal you ask for our explicit help in marketing and promoting your project, which is something that gives me pause.  I feel like it dilutes the brand value of Nouns for us to fund and promote what could be seen as “official” derivative projects.  Everyone is free to create their own Nouns deriv projects, and I support them all wholeheartedly, but at the end of the day, there is only one project that I am here to explicitly promote - Nouns.</p>
<p>From the work samples you have provided, it is clear you guys are very talented and it is awesome to have you engaged in the Nouns ecosystem.  I think this is a great project and I hope you launch it.  Small Grants &amp; Retroactive Funding is here to support your contributions to the ecosystem.  But this is <em>your</em> project, and it is up to <em>you</em> to promote it.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of whitelisting active NounsDAO discord members. That seems like a great way to reward participation in the community for folks who were priced out. <img alt=":+1:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=10" title=":+1:"/></p>
<p>For the social aspect, I think tying into ENS is a great idea. We’re also big fans of ENS, especially how well their team handled the recent airdrop and governance token. I was just talking to <span class="mention">@forager</span> (FOMO Nouns) about how the Nouns website actually displays your ENS instead of just your wallet address — it would be great to embrace ENS where possible. Maybe it could also make sense to take a hybrid approach, where some properties come from the ENS record, and some come from the Proper Noun itself (e.g. its name, in case you own several Proper Nouns).</p>
<p>Thanks for the offer to take this on-chain. We’ll definitely discuss more here and want to hear from other Nouners too before we proceed.</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback <span class="mention">@noun22</span>. We’re thrilled that you like our art style. It’s because we used the original Nouns art style as the base <img alt=":joy:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/joy.png?v=10" title=":joy:"/>.</p>
<p>We definitely hear you on the marketing aspect of the proposal. We can revise the proposal and remove that. Our goal is to help people feel ownership in the Nouns community even though they don’t own a Noun, but we wouldn’t want to dilute the Nouns brand in the process.</p>
<p>Regarding Grants &amp; Retroactive funding, while receiving that would be awesome, I do still want to see if we could make Proper Nouns an official proposal for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Going through the process of submitting a proposal, taking in Nouners/Nounders feedback, and getting approved by the DAO feels very much in the spirit of Nouns and web3, and is a strong indicator that the project aligns with the Nouns vision.</li>
<li>On-chain approval by the DAO brings the project a lot of credibility. We think this would be super helpful for our goal of offering “ownership in the Nouns community”. That’s why we really like <span class="mention">@snape0x</span>’s suggestion of whitelisting active Noun members on Discord — rewarding participation in the Nouns community with ownership helps make this connection clear.</li>
<li>Approved projects get a few distinctions that would be very useful, like a dedicated Discord channel for feedback and posting updates. Also, the distinction of the “Builder” role on Discord would be amazing for our team.</li>
</ol>
<p>In hindsight, “marketing” probably wasn’t the right ask in our proposal, and our team has experience promoting projects so we should be OK there.</p>
<p>What we’re really looking for is to align on the community and vision aspects. We’d like Proper Nouns to feel like an “extension Nouns community” rather than a completely separate community. The 30% of proceeds (potentially ~88 ETH) going back to the Nouns DAO could hopefully be used partly for community-building efforts, since both projects will then benefit from those. I know this would be a new model for a derivative project, but I think it could also be an interesting experiment for growing the community and attracting builders within the Nouns ecosystem.</p>

<p>Hey, appreciate you coming back with thoughtful feedback.  I think I need to clarify what I meant by marketing and promotion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On-chain approval by the DAO brings the project a lot of credibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <em>exactly</em> what I mean by marketing and promotion.  Your project is seeking to take the credibility of the Nouns brand and use an on-chain vote to brand this as what is effectively an “official” derivative project.  I support all derivatives projects, but I don’t think that the DAO has any interest in diluting our brand by explicitly promoting specific derivatives projects as an extension of Nouns.</p>
<p>Also, you go on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We think this would be super helpful for our goal of offering “ownership in the Nouns community”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only way to have ownership in the Nouns community is by owning an interest in a Noun, whether whole or fractional or as part of a SubDAO.  So I really don’t understand why you rejected the idea of buying a Noun with the proceeds.  The only way owning a non-Nouns NFT would give someone ownership of the Nouns community is if Nouns DAO effectively blessed that NFT as an official extension of the Nouns project, which is something the DAO should not support because it dilutes the Nouns brand/scarcity.  Proper Nouns looks like a really cool project and I hope you launch it - but it is not officially affiliated with Nouns DAO.</p>
<p>BTW - I thought the newsletter you posted this morning was awesome and I think you have a future as a valuable community member and contributor!  I want to make it clear this is not personal and I think there IS a path forward here!  I really think you should reconsider your decision not to form a DAO and buy a Noun with the proceeds.  Or be open to receiving Retro Funding for your time and effort.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Noun22</span> expressed what I was trying to get at much more clearly. While we are supportive of the project and team, funding a project for affiliation does not align well with what we feel Nouns DAO should represent. Seeing as you don’t <em>need</em> the funds from the DAO to start up, it might make more sense to launch without the DAO funding it. Either that or reconsidering the DAO-like implementation. Personally, I think the latter is a much more interesting adventure to go on.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@noun22</span> <span class="mention">@seneca</span> Thank you so much for the additional feedback. We discussed it extensively as a team and after looking at the pros and cons, we think it would be better to launch Proper Nouns without trying to go through the on-chain proposal. (And if you see fit to support us through the retro funding, we would gladly accept it! <img alt=":raised_hands:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/raised_hands.png?v=10" title=":raised_hands:"/>)</p>
<p>We thought it was insightful to go through the official proposal process, and we learned a lot about the philosophy and thinking of the Nouns. Since there are already other DAOs that are doing interesting things in this space (Shark/GOOP), if members of our community want to join a DAO and own a fractional part of a Noun, we will point them to those DAOs.</p>
<p>We want to focus on our strengths as a team: art, solidity, and community-building. We think this is the path that will let us be most successful. And knowing that you as individual Nouners/Nounders support us makes us even more confident that Proper Nouns will be great! <img alt=":heart:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/heart.png?v=10" title=":heart:"/></p>
