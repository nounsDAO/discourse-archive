<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Hi Nouns holders and Nouns friends.</p>
<p>Since following Punk 4156 from early on in April 2021 and the journey of the Nouns Dao creation we have been working on various ideas to proliferate &amp; contribute to the project in a physical format from South Africa. Seeing the Nouns project making its way to Kenya is a huge win for the African continent. As a small creative agency we didn’t want to rush a project but rather find the right business in Cape Town that we can partner with, share a common goal, innovate and bring the final idea to market: Nouns Whisky &amp; Nounshine.</p>
<p><strong>2. What is the motivation for Nouns DAO to fund a whisky project in Cape Town?</strong></p>
<p>South Africa needs a Nouns project that can grow &amp; prosper with the longevity of the Nouns DAO. A whisky project typically matures over a span of 3 years, allowing us to create a narrative about the project over this timeline: introducing the project to South Africans and the world month for month over a 36th month period until the whisky is ready to be bottled for the Nft barrel holders.</p>
<p>The Nouns DAO investment will fund infrastructure to set up 365 Whisky Barrels. The DAO will own 300 and the Distillery will own 65. Every barrel will be allocated to an Nft for provenance. The DAO can choose to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allocate the 300 x barrels to 300 x Nouns Nft holders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-sell / auction the Nfts during the 36 month period to recoup the investment or make a profit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Producing whisky for the Nouns DAO: Who is behind Nouns Whisky?</strong></p>
<p>Nouns Whisky will be produced by the Pienaar &amp; Son Distillery located in Cape Town at the V&amp;A Waterfront, Makers Landing small business section. The master distiller Andre Pienaar and his father self-funded this authentic small business and have been able to make it sustainable for more than 7 years. You can view their website, a short video story about the distillery and where it is located in Cape Town. This will allow the DAO to venture into the lifestyle that is Cape Town, South Africa.</p>

<p>As a Master Distiller, Andre has won several accolades for his whisky, gin &amp; vodka at the age of 33. The quality of his spirits is unmatchable in the small business sector and his products are starting to rival the large scale distilleries across South Africa. Andre has always been at the forefront of innovation within the world of spirits and looking at new ways to include technology in his creations &amp; craftsmanship. Nouns Whisky is perfect for this as small businesses start to introduce cryptocurrencies &amp; physical backed Nfts into their revenue models. NounsDAO is innovative and forward-thinking in their approach as the Nouns spread across the world, making this a perfect fit for a digital community in a physical world.</p>
<p><strong>4. Why Nouns Whisky?</strong></p>
<p>In the premium world of whisky, provenance is key and the blockchain now allows a small business owner to benefit from this technology on various levels, also receiving royalties from the potential secondary sales of the whisky barrel Nfts without having to go through a lengthly re-distribution process. Every barrel will be allocated to an Nft and once the whisky is ready to be bottled, a QR code will be attached to each bottle linking the batch to the correlating Nft.</p>
<p>Every Whisky barrel amounts to 40 x (500 ml, 16,9 oz) bottles for the holder. The current scope of the project is 36th months, after this period the holder can burn the Nft to redeem the 40 bottles or enter a further storage agreement with the distillery, allowing the whisky to age further.</p>
<p>The Nouns DAO has invested into the beverage sector with Nouns Coffee and this would be the second addition into this category funded by the DAO.</p>
<p><strong>5. Nouns Whisky Barrel Head NFT’s</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There will be 365 Nfts representing 365 Barrels of Whisky that will be stored in a safe, secure and insured facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will customise the original Nouns Wine Barrel Head into a Nouns Whisky Barrel Head by changing the red wine liquid stream to a golden yellow liquid to represent the whisky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Nouns glasses and bodies will then be customised with traditional African fabric design elements and aesthetics, creating a unique look &amp; feel resonating with the African continent &amp; culture. These 365 Nouns will be randomly generated with the designed assets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. What is Nounshine?</strong></p>
<p>To support the ongoing process of proliferating Nouns in South Africa we decided to develop a product that can exist &amp; easily operate alongside the Nouns Whisky journey, which is affordable &amp; available to the public in a traditional manner via over the counter &amp; online sales. Nounshine (moonshine) will launch in 2023 and will be available for purchase in South Africa. It will not be available to be shipped to America, but the distillery can approach its current export network to extend the reach to Europe and Asia. The small batch Nounshine concept will be funded by the distillery. Included in the Nounshine purchases will be Nouns sticker packs and information about the <a href="http://Nouns.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns.wtf</a> CC0 project &amp; NounsDAO. What it represents culturally &amp; how CC0 is accessible to everyone, everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>7. Nouns Whisky &amp; Nounshine as brands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The creative agency owned by Pierre does not own the 2 x brands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distillery owned by Andre does not own the 2 x brands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We welcome other distilleries across the world to join in the development of the Nouns Whisky &amp; Nounshine concepts, funded or not funded by the Nouns DAO.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. The inception and execution will be broken down into 8 x Phases.</strong></p>

<p>The distilling of 365 whisky barrels starts in late February / early March.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Phase 3 - March 2023</strong></em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>Phase 4 - April 2023</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>9. Nouns Whisky South Africa Project Costs:</strong></p>

<p><em>Andre Pienaar:</em></p>
<p><em>I can confidently say that whisky was always part of the plan, and one of the cornerstone reasons I wanted to start the Pienaar &amp; Son distillery. With the foundation of my fathers’ knowledge of building beautifully sophisticated distillation equipment, and my biochemistry and chemistry degree, I knew we would have a significant advantage in the understanding and manipulation of the fermentation and distillation processes required to produce a world class whisky. There is a lot more at play than making some moonshine and chucking it in a barrel.</em></p>
<p><em>Pierre Coetzee:</em></p>
<p><em>Over a span of 15 years spent in Cape Town &amp; South Africa, active in the skateboarding, music &amp; art scenes: I’ve been fortunate to pioneer and explore these movements through small investments into skateboarders, musicians &amp; artists. I’ve been able to work with the majority of the alcohol &amp; lifestyle brands with sponsorship procurement and speciality brand activations &amp; development. Over the past 20 months I’ve navigated the crypto art industry as a creator &amp; collector, following Punk 4156, his journey, the sale of his Crypto Punk and the inception of the Nouns DAO initiative / collective. We’re in a new era of a cultural revolution supported by cryptocurrencies &amp; DAO’s, this is why I’m approaching Nouns DAO to work with Andre and his local Cape Town business as an anchoring point whereby we can start the proliferation of Nouns in South Africa. This is our first sustainable proposal to the DAO and once proven successful, there will be more opportunities to further introduce Nouns to the melting pot of South African and global cultures that reside here. We live in a beautiful country and need to innovate by using the blockchain as a vehicle to help small businesses to thrive and prosper. Nouns Whisky &amp; Nounshine will be the foundation of our collective journey.</em></p>
<p><em>Brands I’ve collaborated with: Honda Music Stage, Vans, Converse, Puma, Levi’s, Ray-Ban, Red-Bull, Jagermeister, Jose Cuervo, Olmeca, Smirnoff, Jameson Whisky, Three Ships Whisky.</em></p>
<p><em>Artists I’ve worked with in Cape Town as a venue &amp; events manager: Diplo, Steve Aoki, Foals, Public Enemy, DJ Premier, DJ Krush &amp; Seth Troxler.</em></p>
