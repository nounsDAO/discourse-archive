<p><strong>Note: There were some other nouners proposing as Nouns Wallet after we gave out our idea for the wallet. Please don’t confuse us with them. We are NOT Proposal 255. We are the original proposers for Nouns Wallet and our products differ vastly!! We are a completely different team of expert cryptographers, scientists and engineers and have invented our own threshold MPC algorithm for the wallet. Read the Description section below and watch the attached video to know the value proposition of our product! Scroll down below to look up our background!</strong></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Project:</strong></em> Nouns Wallet is a nouns-branded and nouns-themed web extension wallet with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1EWVLH7EglDcLLMEpWV-4mmttxp96wpEe2b4v7jD-2QE/edit" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">latest untrusted (t, N) threshold MPC cryptography</a> that can be utilised for empowering active crypto users and pushing the crypto ethos forward by making security accessible to all in a Nounstandingly simple and agile way.</p>
<p>The threshold MPC algorithm is developed in-house and has various advantages over other implementations of threshold MPC (explained in the “How is our threshold MPC different from others’?” section below in the proposal).</p>
<p><em><strong>Funding ask:</strong></em> total of 275 ETH over 2 rounds (inclusive of 200 ETH for code audit)</p>
<p><em><strong>Estimated Revenue from project to Nouns treasury:</strong></em> Conservative estimate between $3M to $5M a year (plus increased recognition for Nouns) until the wallets industry undergoes the next major revolution. Basis for this estimation is explained in the “Estimated revenue to the Nouns treasury from this project” section below in the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>Hot wallets have low security unless linked to an external hardware wallet (eg. Ledgers). <strong>Well, we have a way to significantly improve the security of hot wallets without having to link them to an external hardware wallet!!</strong></p>
<p>With our credible cryptography skills, we have an innovative collaborative proposal to offer — a nouns-branded web extension wallet system with threshold MPC options incorporated into it. The wallet will use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1EWVLH7EglDcLLMEpWV-4mmttxp96wpEe2b4v7jD-2QE/edit" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">our in-house untrusted (t, N) threshold cryptography</a>, the latest threshold cryptography, to construct a system that simultaneously solves security and agility problems for active crypto users. Having an untrusted (t, N) threshold MPC wallet system where signatures are split among different devices, will reduce the risk of single point of compromised keys. Multiple wallets will need to sign a transaction, in order to make transactions valid. The entire key will NEVER exist in its complete form - neither during generation nor during signing. The 1 minute video below explains the value proposition of our product <strong>(PLEASE WATCH)</strong>:</p><aside class="onebox googledrive" data-onebox-src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16_bd6FIEwdp9RyG7uwjnF6vaah_VZaft/view?usp=sharing">

<p><strong>Funding Rounds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Round 1 - 25 ETH <em>(to be delivered within <strong>2 months</strong> from date of funding)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This round will deliver the proof of concept via testing in an internal network of users, on the following signature schemes:
<ul>
<li>ECDSA</li>
<li>EdDSA</li>
<li>BLS<br/>
Note that the proof of concept will be given only using laptops. Inclusion of other devices like mobile phones is part of full scale development which will be done in Round 2. Front-end will also be taken care of in Round 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round 2 - 250 ETH <em>(timelines TBD; dependent on resource availability and time taken by audits)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>50 ETH for Production-ready code:
<ul>
<li>Front-end and Back-end</li>
<li>The revenue generation model through swap fees - a percentage of the swap fees going to the Nouns treasury and the dev team for maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>200 ETH for code audit - this is necessary to gain credibility in the market</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If proof of concept (round 1) is not completed within the given timeline, Nouns DAO is welcome to discontinue funding this project.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Revenue to the Nouns treasury from this project</strong></p>
<p>MetaMask average daily revenue over the last 2 months from fees looks like around $200,000 a day (translating to $70M a year approx) from eyeballing <a href="https://dune.com/queries/19721/40444" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this chart</a>. More details on daily and cumulative swap fee revenue for MetaMask is on <a href="https://dune.com/tomhschmidt/metamask-swap" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this dashboard</a> and <a href="https://thedefiant.io/metamask-raking-in-170k-day-shows-defi-wallets-work-as-businesses" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this article</a>.</p>
<p>Exodus quarterly revenues for the last 2 year’s Q3s have been $18M and $11M respectively, details on <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/09/2552383/0/en/Exodus-Report-Third-Quarter-2022-Results.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this page</a>.</p>
<p>We aim to compete with MetaMask and other hot wallets by offering the latest threshold MPC system built into a web extension hot wallet.</p>
<p>Going by the numbers above, we conservatively estimate that this project could eventually start generating $3M - $5M per year as swap fees. It could go as high as $70M like MetaMask.</p>
<p>A major portion of that revenue would keep going to the Nouns DAO treasury and a small portion to the devs team for maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Open-Source</strong></p>
<p>The code for our project is open source enough to prove that we can do MPC, not enough to be usable. That way we can protect our core algorithm which has many advantages compared to other threshold MPC implementations in the market (as described in the proposal above). Key generation, pre-signing and signature are open source for EdDSA (which is Cardano, XRP and Polkadot).

<p><strong>Disclosures &amp; background of contributors</strong></p>
<p>The contributors of this project are creators of a subdivision (the R&amp;D department) of the cryptocurrency exchange ZebPay. We are spinning out of ZebPay as the “Insaanity” group, and hence looking for independent funding.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago we began the crypto R&amp;D journey with few principles and beliefs that brought us together. Insanity’s first goal is to reform the financial infrastructure of the world through crypto. Building this threshold scheme is just one of the many contributions we plan to bring to the crypto space in order to help spread the crypto ethos.</p>

<p>Would Nouns own the company with this ask? How would income flow into the treasury if this was done? I like your explainer and it makes sense what you’re doing. I don’t know enough about the tech to speak to that, but maybe <span class="mention">@davidbrai</span> or <span class="mention">@verb-e</span> would take a look?</p>
<p>From a practical standpoint, how does this differ from my Coinbase wallet? I start transactions on my browser, and then confirm on my phone. Is this just doing the same thing? What makes it different?</p>

<p>Nouns will have complete ownership of the wallet. (Not any stake in Insaanity Labs)</p>
<p>Whatever revenue the wallet generates will be split 90-10 between Nouns and Insaanity only for the first 3 years so that we can maintain the wallet. After 3 years, the Nouns community can decide if they want to renew this or want 100% of the revenue to themselves.</p>
<p>We roughly estimate 10% of MetaMask earnings yearly. The links to info on MetaMasks earnings are up in the prop.</p>
<p>And about the Coinbase wallet, allow me some time to find out precisely what they’re doing. But from the info you give, here’s what you need to know. Multiple devices can be used in one of the 3 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>MultiSig</li>
<li>Threshold Signing</li>
<li>Traditional 2 factor authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>If coinbase is using traditional 2FA, it has the following conerns: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://www.exodus.com/support/article/1208-does-exodus-support-2fa#no-integrate" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Does Exodus support 2FA? - Exodus Support</a><br/>
(this article by exodus highlights major conerns with traditional 2FA and why they don’t use it).<br/>
Also, i’d need to know how exactly is the confirmation happening on your phone?</p>
<p>And between MultiSig and Threshold Sig, Threshold Sig is far better in terms of speed, gas, and flexibility of adding/removing devices and refreshing a key share of a device. This is because Threshold Sig requires one final transaction on the blockchain unlike MultiSig which requires as many transactions (or equivalent block space) as the number of keys used. I don’t think Coinbase is using Threshold Sig. With Threshold Sig, you can have as many devices and thresholds as you like. Eg. any 3 of 5, or 4 of 5, or 7 of 10, etc. all from one common public key.</p>
<p>While using Threshold Signing, the key must never be generated as a whole (eg. Shamir Secret Sharing) and then split into devices. This is vulnerable to single point of failure at the time of key generation. Hence key shares of all devices must be generated independently. Our proprietary ThresholdSig has the following advantages over other ones in the market:</p>
<ol>
<li>Completely resistant to DOS attacks (which even Binance TSS Lib is not)</li>
<li>No communication among devices during signing</li>
<li>Faster</li>
</ol>
