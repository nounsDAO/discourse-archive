<p>Summary:<br/>
Our unique DAO-themed device offers phone carrier unlocking services exclusively for specific company phone models. The pocket-sized hardware features USB 3.0 and Type-C connectors, while each phone service provider (T-Mobile, Verizon, ATT, etc.) presents its collection of NFT avatars representing their unique brand. Minted NFTs will have phone model information and randomized trait values, with higher market-rated devices having more valuable NFTs.</p>
<p>Issue/Context (Optional but helpful):<br/>
As the mobile phone market continues to diversify with carrier-specific models, users face challenges in switching between phone carriers due to locked devices. Additionally, the growing popularity of NFTs offers an opportunity to create unique and collectible avatars that resonate with users.</p>
