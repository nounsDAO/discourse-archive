<p>Hey everyone! My name is Dru and i’m an animator from Australia. I’ve only recently discovered Nouns and the Nounish community and have instantly fallen in love! I think what Nouns are doing to help fund more creavite projects for smaller creatives is so amazing! all animators want to do is create their own cool ideas and Nouns are helping with that immensely. Me and my mate Tobias have submitted a pitch to the Nouns 15s short shorts program and would love for people to check it out and see what they think. We’re both inspired by 90s and early 2000s nickelodeon and Cartoon Network shows are thats the vibe we’re aiming for with this short. really fun, cartoony and funny. We’ve got so many ideas for shorts involving the nouns and would love to make one. I hope you enjoy our idea and give it a vote! If you’ve got any questions or just want to chat about cartoons I’ve worked on in the industry, hit me up. I’d love to talk. Enjoy!</p>
