<p> → Now picture NounsDAO as a Network State (see Balaji) with a few houses around the world…<br/>
What does it look like? How to get there?</p>
<p>Maybe starts with a small house, virtual first with collaborative 3D/4D models on the cloud, and then create physical mockups down the line towards a full case study. Rinse and repeat, the Elon Musk way.</p>
<p>Lets go through this with these intentions in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>open source</li>
<li>renewable / low carbon footprint</li>
<li>modular / flexible</li>
<li>community driven</li>
<li>built examples / proven technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Few questions to get us going:</p>
<p><strong>A/</strong> What for? Timeshares, Nouns owners/builders retreat, passive income, Nouns B&amp;B ? etc Go crazy</p>
<p><strong>B/</strong> How do we pick up locations? Proximity to transport, national crypto regulations, climate etc It would be cool to run this experiment within different locations/climate/regulations. Maybe cheap land owned by the foundation is a good start to avoid conflict of interest.</p>
<p><strong>C/</strong> What are open source construction methods for modular homes? Can 20 of us build this using low tech, low energy methodologies that are available anywhere? Can we have a generic blueprint that is adapted depending on the context (economic, material, climate, location etc).<br/>
WikiHouse <a href="https://www.wikihouse.cc/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.wikihouse.cc/</a> is an interesting project that we could fork from imo.</p>
<p>Lastly, since I am sure this will come up with nounish land owners:</p>
<p><strong>D/</strong> How does the land development differ from a traditional process? Who owns the land? Can the property title be legally tied to NFTs via a smart contract? Can it be fractionalized? There were a lot of startups working in this complicated area (Crypto+Land ownership) circa 2017-18, and I haven’t seen a lot of success so far. Do you have any interesting examples or know people who are to do something in that area?</p>
<p>If you have land that could be developed, maybe refrain from posting it here as this might lead to a conversation about the DAO as a land developer and that might not be the most fundamental discussion for now unless we figure out ways to have it being community owned and operated (see D).</p>
<p>Just wanted to start a discussion and see where it can goes.</p>
<p>*Any architects in here? Before Nouns I was an architect specialized in Building Information Modeling (basically building high fidelity 3D/4D complex models/databases to plan execution, costs, risks, operations). If you know about this and are familiar with Catia, Revit, Rhino and large scale digital fabrication etc, lets connect.</p>

<p>In light of <span class="mention">@Facuserif</span> last tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/facuserif/status/1561694587739054087?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/facuserif/status/1561694587739054087?s=20</a></p>
<p>Containers are also very easy to install and modify and there are all sorts of interesting building typologies that can be built using them.</p>
<p>I think it would be great to document nounish possibilities using a mix of containers, and CNC or standard building elements like plywood sheets.</p>

<p>If we really want to go the Elon route, we should start with the Roadster. What would that look like?</p>
<p>I argue one of the most exciting things Nouns can build when it comes to housing is a large villa in a place where nouners can meet yearly for the nouniversary without fear of traveling to place where they might run into federal issues.</p>
<p>Very unfinished idea but ill just leave this here for others to ruminate on.</p>

<p>What type of occupation scenario would make the most sense for the DAO?</p>
<p>I am currently thinking of a B&amp;B village in Indonesia, since it is a digital nomad friendly state and acquiring land as a foreign entity is still relatively cheap (although temporary with a 30 years contract in Bali as far as I know, would have to dive deeper).<br/>
I am saying Indonesia, but you could swap it for emergent states that want to brain drain digital workers away from legacy states. South America, Portugal etc</p>
<p><span class="mention">@krel</span> I think the equivalent of the “Roadster”, if we make the parallel with Tesla, is a nice 2-3 bedrooms villa close to the beach in a beautiful natural environment with a solid access to infrastructure (water/electricity/transport and good internet).<br/>
Nouns holders would get free -or almost free- access to it and would be able to book a certain % days per year and the rest of the time it would be rented as a B&amp;B. It could even accept crypto exclusively, making it niche and appealing to a certain crowd.<br/>
This could start as a sub 300k project but implications could be very powerful on the long run, and if well executed as a business could be a good asset for the DAO, and its becoming as a network state.</p>
<p>What do you guys think about this? Any ideas or comments?<br/>
I’m thinking out loud here, and this is long term, but very curious to hear your thoughts on this.</p>
