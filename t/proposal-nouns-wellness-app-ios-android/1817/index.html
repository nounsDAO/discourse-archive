<a class="anchor" href="#nouns-wellness-app-ios-android-1" name="nouns-wellness-app-ios-android-1"></a>NOUNS Wellness APP (iOS + Android)</h2>

<a class="anchor" href="#who-said-mental-health-needs-to-be-boring-2" name="who-said-mental-health-needs-to-be-boring-2"></a>Who Said Mental Health Needs to Be Boring?</h2>
<p>Nouns can be THE brand at the forefront of bringing wellness to young people worldwide in a playful, effective and engaging way.</p>
<p>Our Mission: To Proliferate the Nouns Brand by Helping Kids Globally Who Are Suffering Mentally After the Global Pandemic – Free of Charge.</p>
<p>We challenged ourselves to design an initiative that prioritized improving overall mental and physical wellbeing irrespective of school, workplace and home settings. An initiative that is comprehensive in nature, flexible in delivery, and aligned with specific wellbeing objectives that are drawn from global social and emotional wellness research. Combining our depth of experience in app development, education and content creation to deliver a remarkable outcome.</p>
<p>We have already created over 100 apps and wellness programs to great success, this will be our best of the best - an innovative, Noun branded mobile app for iOS and Android that will be an important support for kids when they need it most.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#what-are-you-proposing-3" name="what-are-you-proposing-3"></a>What Are You Proposing?</h2>
<p>NOUNS Wellness (name to be confirmed) is a mobile mental health app for the next generation. Using play and community spirit, kids are inspired and engaged with games and activities to actually practice mental health daily.</p>
<p>This proposal will cover details on how we can do this and why we are the team who can make this happen.</p>
<p>And also how this initiative is more than a good idea…</p>
<p>It’s potentially the very essence that makes NOUNS nounish. And what we see is a perfect match to the mission to not only proliferate the NOUNS brand, but also the NOUNS’ mission of goodwill.</p>
<p>LET’S GO!</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-are-you-doing-it-4" name="why-are-you-doing-it-4"></a>Why Are You Doing It?</h2>
<p>Mental health has never been more important post pandemic…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>…And this time it’s the kids who are feeling the pressure, not just stressed out adults or Web3 degens. There are global stats that show some very alarming numbers with teen depression, anxiety and sadly suicides. There’s a lot to find wrong with the world, so activaley reminding, educating and inspiring young people has become integral to their wellbeing and their future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nouns Wellness will also have a natural ripple effect through our Web3 community. As part of the crypto culture, mental health is on everyone’s lips in Twitter Spaces and in Discord, but there has yet to be the wellness project to emerge and really connect with and serve the wider Web3 community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nouns is a project close to our hearts and we are aligned with what it represents. It excites us to see the diverse range of future collaborations and partnerships where we can proliferate the brand and its mission.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-nouns-5" name="why-nouns-5"></a>Why Nouns?</h2>
<p>Something that makes habits stick and fitness routines engaging is play and fun.</p>
<ul>
<li>As pioneers in transforming fitness education with play at its center, we saw immediately how a playful and fun brand like Nouns can boost the wellness conversation with young people.</li>
<li>And at the same time boost the Nouns brand and positioning further, by activating real world engagement with Nouns and the super healthy benefits of a wellness practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a word… Nouns will make wellness FUN. And Nouns are what wellness will look like for young kids. No-one is owning this wellness space for kids the way Nouns can.</p>
<p>(Plus as a Web3 native brand Nouns open the door to the conversation with young people about NFTs and what the blockchain means to our future.)</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#how-is-this-different-to-whats-already-out-there-6" name="how-is-this-different-to-whats-already-out-there-6"></a>How Is This Different to What’s Already out There?</h2>
<p>The go-to apps out there: Headspace, Calm and similar, are designed for adults.</p>
<p>They also only offer one type of mindfulness, (including ones for children) - guided experiences that are consumed in one direction. In our decades of experience with kids (and adults too) we have proven that interactive activities and playful tasks are game changers. Like moving your body with active play instead of reps on a gym mat.</p>
<p>This interactive approach is a major point of difference in the overall physical and mental wellbeing space. There are so many ways of doing wellbeing, but they’re not fun… Until NOUNS Wellness.</p>
<p>Additionally: The app source code we create will be open source and available for use by the Noun community.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#who-is-the-audience-how-are-you-going-to-market-this-app-7" name="who-is-the-audience-how-are-you-going-to-market-this-app-7"></a>Who Is the Audience? How Are You Going to Market This App?</h2>
<p>As established business owners and leaders in the fitness, education and wellness space, we have an active database of 45,000+ teachers, schools, fitness professionals and educators who are actively trusting and consuming everything we create. A recommendation from us to this audience will activate thousands of teachers and schools as users.</p>
<p>Among these people we also have strong and reliable partnerships to further amplify reach and engagement beyond the Web3 universe. Offering free, engaging and ‘cool’ resources for kids’ wellbeing is something these communities are hungry for.</p>
<p>Additionally our wellness podcast features interviews with olympians, human potential leaders, international sports personalities and even actors: Energetic Radio by Dale Sidebottom with 260 episodes, weekly releases and thousands of monthly listeners. We are also both regular speakers and have been on stages in 40+ countries. We will promote the app to our engaged social media channels and activate webinar style campaigns, so NOUNS can leverage our existing network and following.</p>
<p>In short it’s not our first rodeo, we are not a startup like many projects in the Web3 space. We are seeing a synergy between our experience, our existing client base and the Noun brand to elevate both for greater impact – creating the foundations of the future world that Web3 stands for and ideas this project believes in.</p>
<p>We also aim to place Nouns at the forefront of supporting the Web3 community who are battling with extreme emotions of the daily game of NFT’s and Crypto.</p>
<p>Beyond this scope we believe Nouns could have wider appeal to the global issue of declining health and wellness. We see Nouns Wellness as contributing toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Number 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</p>
