<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am excited to have presented a proposal to proliferate NounsDAO in Playa Del Carmen through by incorporating NounsDAO branding into local businesses and providing marketing materials. Additionally, I will undergo a street art campaign featuring tile mosaics and sticker/flyer distribution in high-traffic areas of the city. As an avid street artist and NounsDAO enthusiast, I believe this is a great opportunity to combine my passion for art with the promotion of the NounsDAO brand.</p>
<p>I would love and I am open to any/all feedback and suggestions from the community and would appreciate your thoughts on this proposal. If by any chance I am given the vote of confidence, I will use this as well as my Twitter to share updates and the progress of the project.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
