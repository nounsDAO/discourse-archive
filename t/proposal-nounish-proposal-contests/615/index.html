<p>We propose building an alternative proposal system. Though experimental, it could bring about the boost in creativity the DAO thirsts for.<br/>
The Nounish Proposal Contest is a competition for the most nounish idea. It’s coupled with an airdrop acting as a filtration system and a trustless mechanism for bootstrapping new instances of the contest.<br/>
We’re aiming to improve the ability of non-owners to be part of our narrative and further our perception of what DAOs could be.</p>
<p><img alt="snapshot-ticketPIXX" data-base62-sha1="pns1rj3fAAR1owX6RfAFVjeShHe" height="302" src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/original/1X/b1dd027791bbbc3df9b2fb3a161cab105e6a484c.png" width="629"/></p>
<p>The premise is extremely straight-forward. A multi-sig is created and funds representing the reward are forwarded to it. Each Noun owner<br/>
automatically recives a number of tokens(conveniently called NPC tokens). Each one of the tokens representing an opportunity to participate in the<br/>
competition. All ideas will be collected on Snapshot and will be voted on by Nouns, bringing forth the winner and rewarding the most nounish idea of<br/>
them all.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Project Details:</strong></strong><br/>
<strong>Snapshot</strong><br/>
An off-chain(gasless) decentralized governance platform with easy to verify results. It creates a blockchain snapshot at a given point in time, uploads it to a decentralized storage system and assigns rights to users based on it. It uses IPFS for storage and message signing for voting and voting power assignment.</p>
<p>Snapshot’s dashboard is familiar to a pretty big number of people who are already participating in decentralized governance and many established organizations are currently using it. Our Snapshot-Space, once integrated will provide a free, user-friendly, upgradeable and easy-to-maintain client for community members to propose and vote on the most nounish ideas.</p>
<p><strong>The token</strong> is the main element around which the contest will function.<br/>

Tokens act as an organic filtration system. And depending on the way the dao chooses to distribute them, they could have quite impactful<br/>
power. They limit the number and scope of entries, improve relationships and cooperation within the community and they are an additional incentive<br/>
for its recipients to participate.</p>
<p><strong>The Factory</strong> enables bootstrapping of new nounish proposal contests by trustlessly deploying new NPC contracts, minting NPC Tokens and automatically distributing them. All through one single transaction by the DAO.<br/>
The end goal is to make the process of Nounish Proposal Contest creation automatic, enabling the DAO to start new contests trustlessly whenever a consensus is reached.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Project Deliverables:</strong></strong><br/>
<strong>Contract Development</strong><br/>
The NPC Token Contract<br/>
The Factory Contract - used to create new NPC contracts , mint and distribute tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure Development</strong><br/>
Sapshot strategy, validation<br/>
*optional fron-end customizations.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Project funding:</strong></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are asking for a grant through Small Grants Fund to support further research on this subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Miscellanea:</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This proposal, although it has similarities does not come as a competitor to the PropHouse proposal. They are different projects with different goals in mind. That said, I believe the two could have great synergy and components could be shared in future versions.</li>
<li>The infrastructure is UI-agnostic,  the use of Snapshot is not imperative.</li>
<li>In order to further the trustless nature of the infrastructure, an oracle module can be implemented in the multi-sig wallet that would enable it to distribute the rewards autonomously. But we do not yet feel safe enough with current oracle options.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Project Ethos:</strong></strong><br/>
We’ll open-source and document everything we create.<br/>

<p>We aspire to bring more people into the story of our movement. By making the contest proposals and votes collection off-chain, rendering them gasless and affordable to anyone with an internet connection, we’re aiming to build Nounish Proposal Contests into an accessible way of engagement, turning Nouns DAO into a fun entry point to crypto for all every-day people.</p>
