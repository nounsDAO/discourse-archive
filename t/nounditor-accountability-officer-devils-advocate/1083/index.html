<a class="anchor" href="#who-am-i-1" name="who-am-i-1"></a>Who am I:</h3>
<p>Maty, writer of Nounsletter, founding member of Nouncil, creator of nounish poker deck, <em>and a self proclaimed watchdog.</em> As some of you might’ve noticed, I have been active in Nouns since I joined, and I am always trying to promote healthy conversations. I try to provide feedback, onboard newcomers, follow up with prop builders, and do what I can to reduce spam in the Discord.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#problem-2" name="problem-2"></a>Problem:</h3>
<p>There’s an accountability gap between the DAO and its funded projects. There have been multiple conversations about the benefit of having a dedicated person in charge of bridging the gap. Holding builders accountable will help create a healthier and open ecosystem, foster trust, and set up standards for what the proposal-to-project pipeline should look like. I have started doing this type of work and would like to continue doing so in a more formal way.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#scope-of-work-3" name="scope-of-work-3"></a>Scope of work:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Follow-up with builders of proposals, prop house auctions (and maybe small grants), about their funded project’s status.</li>
<li>Maintain a public spreadsheet to better document the progress and timeline.</li>
<li>Report findings regularly on a biweekly basis with a simple status update and more detailed info where necessary.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#funding-4" name="funding-4"></a>Funding:</h3>
<p>2.5 ETH/month for 3 months as a trial run (via small grants)</p>

<p>I think this is great. Most nouners don’t have the time to make builders accountable for what they commit to do. Having a paid role to make sure that we get reports on the status of all the projects we fund will be very valuable - will increase the likelihood of delivery and will help us identify builders who execute (and those who don’t).</p>
<p>I trust maty to do a great job given his dedication to nouns.</p>

<p>Thank you for this thoughtful proposal.</p>
<p>While I like the idea of seeing the progress of all the projects that have been funded, I do not like the wording of a single person “holding builders accountable.” I do not like the authority of an “officer” or a “watchdog.”</p>
<p>Recently Nouners have been adding themselves to proposals as point person to liaise between the DAO and the builder(s). I think this is a much healthier model going forward. For proposals that came earlier, I think it is ok that we use them as learning experience if their progress is slower than we would expect.</p>

<p>The problem we have is that no one has a handle on the state of all the things, where they sit, what progress looks like, and in that environment, a Nouner is incapable of knowing what has has happened much less what is happening and we will be worse at course correcting and making better informed future decisions.</p>

<p>Hey 9999,<br/>
I don’t think this would give me any special authority over anyone. I also didn´t mean for it to sound like I will be “going after” anyone, quite the opposite, I am interested in what people are building and this would allow me to dedicate more of my time to them.<br/>
I would like to create a list of all the stuff Nouns are funding (have funded) and track the progress of these projects (the list would include builder’s socials, links to updates (discord, social media posts, external), the results, media coverage, etc).<br/>
This would highlight the wonderful projects that we funded and let us celebrate but also allow us as a group to learn from our mistakes. A lot of people lose track of the projects we fund after they vote because it’s hard to keep up with everything, my work would allow anyone to see what´s going on just by taking a quick glance.</p>

<p>Hey Maty and nouns,</p>
<p>As a builder I think your interest has helped us move forward and deliver, so I trust that you are a good fit for the task. It is true that we need to create some accountability for all proposals to make sure we increase our rate of success.</p>
<p>But I also agree with 9999 and I am not sure this should be concentrated in one resident “officer”.</p>
<p>“to see what´s going on just by taking a quick glance” we could build an app that tracks proposal delivery and builders score. Some interesting data to have would be: funding, nouner sponsor, milestones, deadline, deadline extensions etc.</p>
<p>We could do a small grant to kick things off, start with a spreadsheet with Maty and get input from the community. Maybe Maty can assemble a nounish team to build this project management app and become a builder himself? Im sure it would be helpful to have you as a prop builder as well.</p>

<p>Thank you. Yes that sounds useful and that list should probably live somewhere on Nouns Center (cc <span class="mention">@Coralorca</span> <span class="mention">@cdt.eth</span>)</p>
<p>Again, my only concern is with the language of “auditor”, “officer”, “devil’s advocate”, “watchdog”, etc. and any official status that such adversarial terms convey.</p>
<p>In summery: NO to the racoon wearing the police uniform, YES to the cat taking notes on progress.</p>

<p>hey maty, thanks for the proposal.</p>
<p>wrt prop house, we have plans to implement systems to incentivize accountability and would prefer not have one person “watching” over builders. ultimately, i think high quality builders will build, regardless of needing to report or not.</p>
<p>echoing 99’s thoughts, i am against any sort of protocol-wide role (“officer”) holding people accountable. i am for <em>documenting</em> what’s happening within the ecosystem (similar to what nouns.center is doing). in that regard, you have my full support!</p>

<p>love the idea of a publicly available dashboard that is neutral and credibly maintained for on-chain props, and agree with 9999 and others that this shouldn’t any singular role/title, but I would support a prop that is funding maty to build this type of thing out.</p>

<ul>
<li>check out “additional information” sections for valuable info about reading these lists</li>
<li>you can find updated info on uncomplete proposals like On-chain prop 7, 11, 28, 36 and Prop House props Coffee Mugs and Nounify bot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any feedback is appreciated. Is there any info missing?</p>
<p>While creating the lists/databases of proposals, I thought it would be cool to have the option of looking at “profiles” of individual builders, so I created a third list called Nounfolk where you can see all these builders. Most of the profiles don’t have much information (apart from the automatically synced Proposals), but I tried to get Nouncillors to personalize their profiles, so feel free to take a look at these. A list like this could be used in projects like Prop 63, Nouncil´s proposals etc, since it contains basic data about builders (discord and twitter IDs, ENS, proposals).</p>

<p>As someone making a proposal right now I have to say having a clear single or limited number of folks to keep in sync with about progress is really valuable. For us it’s important that the DAO as our client knows and understands that we are doing what we promised to do. Raising awareness around project updates can be its own significant effort in addition to whatever work we’ve committed. Having a clear, semi-centralized process for project updates and accountability where  we can feel like we’ve made reasonable efforts to be transparent and keep our client up to date is really important for us and reduces friction for prop creators IMO.</p>

<p>Any more notes on <em>why</em> the administrators of prop <span class="hashtag">#63</span> deemed the funds were unable to be disbursed constructively?</p>

<p>The administrator structure of the prop has been kind of loose - the onchain prop only mentions wag specifically and other admins were supposed to be appointed from those who were willing to help (nouncil is only holding the funds till distribution, this is not a nouncil prop).<br/>
Toady, Joel, me and others showed interest.</p>
<p>Before wag went MIA, he has been trying to create a list of all builders within the community (with their respective projects and funding amounts) to give an overview for the future coordinape. But due to the loose admin structure and wag being MIA, the fact that there even was a hard deadline was forgotten, and nobody stepped up to take over the prop in time.</p>
<p>This is not meant to blame it all on wag of course, all of us who showed interest in administrating the prop are to be blamed.</p>

<p>Hi there … sorry for the delay just circling back on this a bit now that I am digging in more.</p>
<p>I reviewed the notion sites you have linked and found them very informative, thanks for that.  I was curious on this image that you sent across and was wondering where I might be able to go to find where it was taken from? I am particularly interested if the totals (in terms of # of projects and ETH distributed) were kept updated over time as I would like to share this image out in the research piece I am writing but want to make sure it is current when I publish.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the help!</p>

<p>Hey there … it’s me again.  I wanted to ask another question here related to the information provided.  I was able to review the small grants funding page along with the notion site.  I did have a couple more questions related to the small grants if you might be able to help with some insights?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I noticed on the notion site that the “cause” columns are linked to external content but when I try to click on each of those it seems the links aren’t working for me.  I just wanted to check out some of the projects and where the rows linked and wanted to see if some way to allow view access?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanted to know how nouns has been tracking the impact or completion of the grants that have been submitted?  In the documentation it mentions that the funding committee will monitor the community and I just wanted to see if any kind of other tracking mechanisms in place I could take a look at that show how the projects progressed and if they met the milestones that were agreed upon?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide.  I am getting some great details in the research report I am compiling you guys have done a great job in putting together a lot of information that is not so easy to find with other programs I have researched.</p>

<p>(1) Could you please provide which links are not working for you? I recently copied this database from the original small grants notion page so there might indeed be some things that dont work properly.</p>
<p>(2) I do not think anyone has been measuring the impact of proposals/projects. i think by “monitoring” they meant they will search for people who deserve retroactive reward as opposed to tracking the impact of funded proposals</p>

<p>You are seriously so helpful … thank you.  I can tell you that the response I have received from other programs is nowhere near like this so know I really appreciate it <img alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" width="20"/></p>

<li>
<p>This is the notion page where the links don’t seem to work for me:<br/>
<a class="inline-onebox" href="https://noun22.notion.site/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Notion – The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no worries on this just curious.  I did find where you are tracking the grants progress in a separate page so I think that would probably be ample for the research that I am conducting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again … I may have some more questions as I progress.   I am probably half way through the research report that I am writing at this point!</p>
