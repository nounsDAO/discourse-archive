<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>The point of this prop is to make Nouns more than just a “sponsor” at an event. Bringing the Nouns to the absolute FOREFRONT of the NFT space through an IRL conference in Toronto.</p>
<p>I wanted to start ideating on how we can involve as many sub daos as possible into this proposal. essentially im going to run the entire event nouns themed and make sure that nouns are maximized across Toronto for the entire month of June.</p>
<p>I have some initial ideas but really wanting to get as many groups involved as possible.</p>
<p>First idea: Nouns Prop House LIVE (taking live pitches from buildooors with ideas)</p>
<p>Main Stage MC’d by <span class="mention">@Toady_Hawk</span>#8950 and <span class="mention">@aubtoshi</span>#9612</p>
<p>Free booths for the sub daos that want to attend</p>
<p>The Noun Square Live podcast at the content workshop</p>
<p>Noggles for as many people as we can make noggles</p>
<p>Speakers to wear noggles for a photo before starting</p>
<p>Nouns at the Kickoff party at Cabana Pool Bar on the 22nd</p>
<p>Nouns branding at VIP Mixer event at El Mocambo June 23rd.</p>
<p>Super large inflatable Noun ( <span class="mention">@JoshuaFisher</span>#0001 idea) <span class="mention">@Bigshot</span> Klim#1853 has source</p>
<p>Month long advertising in Union Station</p>
<p><strong>new position instead of “sponsoring”</strong><br/>
<em>Nouns as the main <strong>collaboration partner</strong> for the event looking to help others in the NFT industry collaborate, share ideas and shepherd those builders into the next iteration of the Web3 space moving us all forward.</em></p>
<p>Nouns to be able to volunteer and participate in the build up of the event etc. more than just a “sponsor”</p>
<p>SOOOOOOOOOO MANY IDEAS! <img alt=":star_struck:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/star_struck.png?v=12" title=":star_struck:" width="20"/></p>
<p>I would love to hear more ideas!</p>
<p>KEEP IN MIND, this is a very expensive operation to run an event and do as much as we want for the nouns. so the final prop will include as much as we can without going absolutely insane with it.<br/>

<p>Nouns as the main <em><strong>Collaboration Partner</strong></em> for the event looking to help others in the NFT industry collaborate, share ideas and shepherd those builders into the next iteration of the Web3 space moving us all forward.<br/>
Requesting 300 ETH for NFT Toronto to Nounify the entire event with help from the entire nouniverse.</p>
<p><strong>Brought to you by: NickyG, Nouncil, Sharks, Ugly DAO, Nouns OTG, Nouns Esports, Lil Nouns DAO, Snouns, Noundles, NOTC, Food Nouns</strong></p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#who-is-nickyg-5" name="who-is-nickyg-5"></a>Who is NickyG?</h2>
<p>Well, good question, I haven’t been in the Nouns too long. But anyone who knows me in the ecosystem knows I dove head first and my mission is to take my expertise and make a large impact. I own 3 other companies in Web3 and in my opinion have had great success with them. Bridg3 is my marketing agency and I work with a ton of top Content Creators and projects in NFTs to collaborate and facilitate relationships with founders building in the space. To date, we have helped over 265 projects and in doing so helped to generate over $165 million in revenue. TenX Tools is a new company of mine in which I acquired a software company to deliver NFT analytics and botting to users, in under a week we had over 500 sign ups (high numbers for a bot). Lastly, my NFT project W.I.T.S. Which has yet to launch but hopefully you all see it as a great success.<br/>
That’s my background in this space and why I think I can take this opportunity and provide tangible valuable results for the Nouns through an IRL event utilizing all of the Network I have in this space and making the Nouns a Centerpiece of a large event in the industry.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#tldr-6" name="tldr-6"></a>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Why do we want to be this involved? More proliferation of the nouns means more interest within our industry for all things nouns and nouns sub groups. Which will return more interested people taking part in all of the ecosystems restoring the glory and value the nouns were once at. Right now, nouns aren’t known the entire space. That is an issue, The Nouns should consistently be in front of the entire NFT industry by participating in these IRL events so that people know the Nouns are ALL OVER the NFT space and that the community is WAY MORE than the small groups we have (only around 340 total holders of Nouns DAO).</p>
<p>Being the main group at the event and making it VERY clear to all attendees that Nouns are a massive part of NFTs is the goal of this prop. SO BIG it is right in your face type of exposure. Participating in events in a small capacity is great but garners small attention. So the proposal here is to prove why Nouns should be a MAJOR part of any Mainstream NFT industry event.</p>
<p><strong>ROI meets Proliferation efforts.</strong></p>

<p>Hi ponti,</p>
<p>So the actual amount she had dedicated to the event was 15k and that is for the Nouns OTG spots they are doing. This larger prop is to get everyone involved and take the nouns in front of the massive brands, companies and creators we have coming to the event. Amazon, Mastercard, polygon, ledger, moonpay etc. Large creators and founders will see the Nouns taking a step and having a massive involvement in the NFT space.</p>
<p>There is a lot were doing for this. Ive almost unintentionally turned it into a nouns event XD</p>
<p>its a large amount but it comes with tangible ROI and measureables with it.</p>
<p>The month long advertisements in the Union station concourse alone will bring over 2 million impressions.</p>
<p>Not to mention being in the face of CEOs/CMOs etc from some of the top brands in the space.</p>
