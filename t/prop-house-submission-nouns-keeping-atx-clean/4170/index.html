<p>Hello everyone! I am new to the Nouns community. I was introduced to the community through <span class="mention">@Aubtoshi</span> at SXSW, they are working on a documentary sponsored by NounsDAO and I thought that was amazing and also aligned with many things I’m involved with.</p>
<p>I decided to get into the water and submitted for a small grant via prop.house, you can check it out here: <a href="https://prop.house/proposal/4448" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://prop.house/proposal/4448</a></p>
<p>If I do receive this grant, I plan on exploring more ways I can integrate with the Nouns ecosystem. I’m a musician in Web3 and also Co-foudner of YouniDAO and apart of many other communities including Headphone Homies, Campfire, and Hifi Labs. YouniDAO recently received a grant from Lens to do an event at SXSW which was a huge success!</p>
<p>I’m very grateful to be here!</p>
