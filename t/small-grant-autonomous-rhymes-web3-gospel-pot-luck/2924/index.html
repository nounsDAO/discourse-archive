<p><strong>I want to take over &amp; replenish the soil with the <span class="hashtag">#ethereum</span> that god has given</strong>, from Vitalik his soul glistens, marble with code it’s written, freedom let’s go we rippin’ freedom of speech here we come with a pitch to flip the switch of monetary economics &amp; shit, it’s code fundamental blocks, primitive, it’s auditable with proof of ownership, you know this is the best flow it is for the world to overcome it’s bored and drum broken to none, kill it with the sun, gamma rays rhythmically say today we gonna kill it slay.</p>

<p>If NounsDAO could provide me with a micro grant, I would like to buy all of the equipment to begin producing music. I am looking to build out a full home setup.</p>
<p>If anyone in the community knows the music business, It has it’s flaws and I want to show them by poking holes in the web2 model, show them what about Nouns is cool, share &amp; spread the wealth of permissionless p2p censorship resistant tech.</p>
<p>I am asking for anywhere between <strong>2.5-10k</strong> as a grant.</p>
<p>Anyone that collects <a href="https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/UrM7bpTlfZYn2hG12EY8B0CBZf4Uh6e3ZEv4Vg2LBIs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this piece</a> or <a href="https://create.zora.co/collections/0x6ac99d6f56c4802d607d06cbb5141a06ca4d0c43" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this one</a> will get access to my future drops as well.</p>
<p>If nouns supports me directly with a grant, I will create <strong>NounsDAO Token Granted Access in the Wordsmiths discord</strong>, where I will be educating people on everything that I have learned in my 5-years of web3 &amp; Nouns will have early access to new songs / slam poetry that I write.</p>
<p>I will produce a song for <strong>NounsDAO</strong> if you guys can support me, I’ll even take suggestions on what to rhyme about, but I am happy to take it upon myself too.</p>
<p>Please feel free to jump in here and give some feedback, but I would be honored if <strong>NounsDAO</strong> supported me at the beginning of my artist journey to propagate everything that is being built in web3.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Pretty interesting concept. I’d like to see more examples. It seems like you’re experimenting and finding your voice. Continue to do so, play with different formats, lengths, and styles. Add some beats and keep creating.</p>
<p>I’m not a decision maker for NSFW, but I would say this still seems to early to garner funding, and it doesn’t feel nounish to me at this point either.</p>
<p>Last thing, check out <a href="https://www.nounsounds.wtf/">nounsounds</a>. Maybe there’s a way for you to partner to make some cool cc0 music content together.</p>
