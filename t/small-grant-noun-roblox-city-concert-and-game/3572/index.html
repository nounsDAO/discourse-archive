<p>Hello <strong>Nounish</strong><br/>
My name is Toxicfication Musician and developer from Thailand<br/>
this is some idea for my project</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>I’m excited to present our innovative metaverse concert project, which aims to revolutionize the music industry by creating a new and immersive way for artists to connect with their fans, and for fans to experience live music. Our metaverse concert will feature interactive elements, virtual merchandise, virtual meet and greet, customizable avatars, and a state-of-the-art virtual stage design, providing a truly unique and unparalleled concert experience. Our project is inspired by the virtual band Gorillaz, but with an added twist, utilizing the power of blockchain technology for fractional ownership of music elements.</p>
<p><strong>Problem statement:</strong></p>
<p>The music industry has been greatly impacted by the pandemic, with live concerts and tours being cancelled or postponed, leaving both artists and fans feeling disconnected. Traditional concerts also have geographical limitations, making it difficult for fans from all over the world to attend. Other metaverse projects lack the necessary experience in creating safe and child-friendly environments. Our metaverse concert addresses these challenges by providing a new and innovative way for artists to connect with their fans, and for fans to experience live music, regardless of their location, while also ensuring a safe and child-friendly environment.</p>
<p><strong>Use of funds:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$8,000 for the development of interactive elements such as mini-games and quizzes</li>
<li>$10,000 for virtual merchandise such as in-game t-shirts, posters, and other items related to the concert.</li>
<li>$5,000 for virtual meet and greet.</li>
<li>$5,000 for virtual stage design and special effects.</li>
<li>$8,000 for blockchain platform and smart contract development</li>
<li>$2,000 for miscellaneous expenses such as marketing and promotion of the concert.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<p>Our metaverse concert has the potential to greatly impact the music industry by providing a new and innovative way for artists to connect with their fans, and for fans to experience live music. The concert will have a global reach, allowing fans from all over the world to attend, regardless of their location. The interactive elements and virtual merchandise will also provide a new revenue stream for artists, and the virtual meet and greet will provide a new level of engagement for fans.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>We believe that our metaverse concert project has the potential to revolutionize the music industry and provide a new and innovative way for artists to connect with their fans, and for fans to experience live music. The grant from the Noun DAO will be essential in supporting the development of the project and bringing it to fruition.</p>

<p>Looks good! I love the child friendly atmosphere addition to using in Roblox. I have a 4 year old daughter so getting them integrated into web3 this way is a great way IMO. I love the addition of the digital wearables. That what we have down the pipe line also with The Fashion Dao and can read more when we drop our proposals soon. Good luck!</p>
