<p>What’s up everyone! I resubmitted my ATX clean up project with some major upgrades, including the COMPOST NOUN trait. I wanted to take this grant to the next level and make it multi-dimensional. I’m all about bridging the gap between the URL &amp; IRL. I submitted for both the Art &amp; IRL grant for Hack Week!</p>
<p><strong>Compost Noun:</strong><br/>

<p>The Art submission is centered around two Nouns traits I created.<br/>
<em>1. Compost Head</em><br/>
<em>2. Recycle Mouth</em></p>
<p>This Nouns represents being a responsible earth loving Noun, which we all need some more Nouns like this. This piece of art is also tied to the IRL experience I want to curate in ATX</p>
<p><strong>Nouns Keeping ATX Clean: Nouns Trash Bags &amp; Noggle Photos</strong><br/>

<p>Not only will we bring together a couple hundred local Austin creatives &amp; entrepreneurs to do a day of trash pick up, but we also would like to create compostable Nouns trash bags. I am looking into a few different companies that allow branding on these bags.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the submission, we will supply food drinks, supplies, and more to create a day full of connections and earth loving fun. There’s nothing like the feeling of cleaning up our earth and doing it with other people. I can’t wait to curate this experience, I know it will be transformative for so many people.<br/>
