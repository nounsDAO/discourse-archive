<p>What do you think about entering into partnerships with large entities?  How do you view entering into collaborations/cooperations with companies from the non web.3/NFT world?<br/>
E.g. I think that nouns would be able to use its position in the NFT/web 3. world to proliferate companies from outside this circle, in exchange for cooperating with them in the real world, thus expanding its proliferation and the influx of more potential future buyers of nouns.</p>
<p>Would it make sense to go outside the scheme in this way?</p>
<p>I invite all community members to discuss. Always when brainstorming, you can come to interesting conclusions.</p>

<p>I work with multiple large brands, world renowned artists and studios and have been trying to onboard them to NOUNs. There has been a lot of interest and also a lot of push back. It is a very delicate dance that needs some proper planning and tools. We definitely need a full pod to build the tools and for onboarding those types of partners.</p>

<p>This is also a good way to go.<br/>
Especially if, in the future, such companies would pay a portion of the revenue to the treasury from the profit earned. On the other hand, I was referring here to larger entities that are unlikely to report to the DAO themselves that they will perform some service for nouns (For reasons that they are such large companies that they don’t have to). We are talking about such large companies, which often have a global footprint.  And so, for example, nouns could provide some service in web3 for such companies that want to carve out a piece of the pie in the web3/NFT space in the future, but don’t know how yet because they have no idea how to adapt it. ( How to adapt their business profile under web3/NFT)<br/>
Such a service (to start with) could be at least marketing.  And let me point out right away, I don’t mean that such big companies should sponsor nouns.</p>

<p>I ask because you have to start somewhere. For a good start, informally, hence the topic as a free discussion, where everyone has the opportunity to share their thoughts.  I think to break the reluctance of large companies to work together with nouns, it is necessary to create an adaptation for them to web3. Hence my question to you referred to what was the reason for the reluctance to enter into cooperation with nouns.<br/>
By the way, I was very curious about fast food in particular. Does this company have a large number of locations?</p>

<p>Based on what I have seen over the past year the bigger brands. and big name artists will not come here with a proposal. some may come to look around kick some tires through a research assistant or an intern and not go through the prop process, It is too complex and risky for busy people. I think that if there was a pod created specifically to put pitches and presentations to headhunt worthwhile collaborators and present them with relevant projects that they can get behind and be rewarded for. spamming MR Beast on socials with “work with nouns will give  you 250K” is not an actionable ask. Putting a proposal together that outlines a creative activation for him to take part in and covering the costs and fees is better, it would give a potential partner a clear idea of what to do . It is the same with any other big brand or potential partner. If we wish to work with someone we need to approach them with a reason why they should. “we have a 40Mil treasury to spend on stuff”  is not going to attract the best people in my opinion</p>

<p>Of course it is. I agree 100%<br/>
I’ve been thinking myself about what such a headhunting process for nouns could look like, and what could be offered to valuable artists/managers in exchange for their work. Here, too, for a good start, one could start by determining who to date, in the community what capabilities and what they can acquire for nouns.</p>
<p>As for acquiring large companies, here the matter is not obvious. Because we can try to look for partnerships, but they must also give a tangible benefit to the partners and not just the nouns.  Ideally, it should be web3 participation. Here, as I mentioned, adaptation is needed for their businesses in web3.</p>

<p>I have a suggestion, which I will soon propose here.  Why I say it. It seems to me that it can show an interesting path that nouns can follow. At the same time, it presupposes precisely in the long run to obtain cooperation with large entities, while distributing and selling the product, where part of the funds would go to the treasury.  Of course, if the proposal is to the liking of the community and there is a will on the part of the DAO to vote FOR.<br/>
That’s why I set up this topic, to raise these issues, to see what people think, but other than you, so far a weak response from others.</p>
<p>As for the channel on discord.  As much as possible, there should be one, where you could invite people from different industries, in order to work out the possibilities.</p>

<p>Proposals and Ideas are great and always welcome. You do have to be able to show that you have the understanding of the industry you are proposing for and hav connections or means to execute your vision. If you do not have those it will be hard to get funding to just blindly explore an idea no matter how good it may be. You may want to start small with a small grants prop first to test the waters.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about how my company could work with Nouns for sometime now. We aren’t F500 but work with a good amount of them.  I am a big fan of the Nouns and I’d like to contribute and see if partnership synergies could work.</p>
<p>Unsure if it’s common practice on here but I would be open to tossing around ideas on a call in the next few weeks. If you or anyone thinking along these lines would be open let me know.</p>

<p>To me it’s not about building a brand based on partnerships with big brands, pushing your product there.  And as far as I can see that’s what your article is about.<br/>
Only to use them to create their big brand based on cooperation. Those are two different paths.  The former for nouns, strongly weakens the position, the latter is desirable. I also can’t imagine collaboration forced by the moment. That is, nouns are on a roll then they enter into deals with big brands. It is known how this will end, nouns will be abandoned.<br/>
What is needed for nouns is a path like the one taken by Rimac, entering into a JV with Bugatti (VAG).<br/>
I think that just as Rimac as a black horse of the automotive market can teach Bugatti a lot, Bugatti can give Rimac a lot.<br/>
Nouns may still be small , but in web3 it can be Rimac. Be it already is.</p>

<p>I can’t recall a case where a character brand in its formative stage has ever been helped by collaborating with large brands. Even Tokidoki had to work up to LeSportSac, and some will argue that the bag collab, long term, is what held them back vs propelled them. One thing is clear… what worked 20 years ago no longer creates the same element of wonder. Brand association is far too “expected” by the general public, and in general, interpreted as marketing.</p>
<p>Chasing awareness typically leads to doom. Instead, character brands find success (to various degrees) when they become one with culture (vs marketing to them).</p>
<p>Bugatti presents zero context right now. There’s no element of awe or surprise. It’s too expected.</p>
<p>That said, I do believe nouns is 100% on the right path to earning collaborations with an unlimited number of major brands in a way so that each will hold meaning.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we are chasing validation, and in my opinion, the wrong way.</p>

<p>I suggest such because aligning with either would place us in certain physical settings where nouns has a greater potential to be a source of discovery, and create meaning.</p>
<p>Instead of a collab with the Ford Motor Company, align with places, and the entities Ford wishes they could collaborate with. Slowly adding their tribes to our own until they are one.</p>
<p>A Dehara Nouns would bring the true curiosity of thousands. Then do 100 more like that, at that level, and found in physical oasis’s away from the noise of marketing… until nouns carries true meaning via association and juxtaposition to millions.</p>

<p>It seems to me that, as a character designer, you are looking too much only from the “character brand” angle. Here nouns as a brand, has something more to offer. And the noun characters themselves are just a certain outgrowth. Certainly not limited only in this particular space.<br/>
As I wrote above, the need is to develop an adaptation model for large companies to web3. Evidently they are not coping with it. The market is still too fresh. Of course, nouns can pioneer this kind of action.<br/>
That is, nouns gives solutions to such a large company in web3. These could be, for example, SubDAO of their brands subsumed under nouns.<br/>
In return, nouns gets “space” in their spheres of activity.<br/>
It is obvious that NOUNS will not be able to compete with the giants and there is no need to push themselves where they don’t need to.<br/>
Of course, this is just an example and depends on the question of how to approach the subject.<br/>
Nevertheless, thanks for the needed voice in the discussion. Certainly valuable.</p>

<p>Thank you for the insight, which holds merit to be sure ( I am less of a character designer than I am a character brand owner and director ).</p>
<p>Due to the CC0 nature of nouns, their being “web 3” more than a character brand, or only a character brand, is not really our call, and consumer behavior is what it is, at least at the moment.<br/>
That said, we have an “early to the table” opportunity to have a direct impact more now than we might in the future.</p>
<p>While I personally believe the beauty of the protocol will drive its future, the nouns as characters draws  outsiders in, the way Space X inspires youth through the dream of humans one day becoming a space faring species… while in reality, Space X is a delivery and service company.</p>
<p>Knowing what we know, the slower we race towards “big brands”, the more time we have to craft a more nounish model VS wrapping nouns imagery on yet another surface.</p>
<p>Brand collaborations are, in general, the best way to end the long term potential of a character brand, unless handled with specific care.</p>
<p>While we may think the market we are in is new, we are up against Sanrio. That train has left the station.</p>

<p>Big brands colaborate with whatever flavor of the week shows up at their door step, and once they are done they move on to the next big shiny thing. Nouns needs to focus on our own path and selectively curate partnerships. If Nike wanted to use nouns they can just go ahead and do it, Samsung just did that at NFTNYC last year.  I am all in on <span class="mention">@DAVID</span> strategy I have traveled with him to Japan and Korea to see what he is talking about first hand and I think that the path he is proposing for colaborations is a good one. having said that anyone can use nouns from Sony to Delta airlines to porn-hub, this is the crazy experiment we are all running right now.</p>

<p>Web3 projects are often more focused on selling stories and intellectual property (IP). Compared to web2 companies, web3 is known to be a smaller, more exclusive community with less reach. This makes it difficult for web3 companies to be effectively promoted within web2. In other words, most web2 users need to understand what web3 has to offer before they can be attracted to web3 projects. Therefore, web3 projects should promote themselves in web2 by creating an easily understood IP. Of course, the IP image must be popular and unique enough to attract people.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Nouns should consider the following questions: What benefits do Nouns bring to web2 users, and what is their competitive advantage in the market? Do web2 users have a need for Nouns-based products? What kind of business model is suitable for Nouns?</p>
<p>These are some of my thoughts. Let’s discuss them further!</p>
