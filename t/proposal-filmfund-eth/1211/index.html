<p>Dear Nouns DAO,</p>
<p>We are pleased to meet your formal acquaintance and respectfully propose the following. We began working on the filmfund.eth project before learning about Nouns. Now, we connect with you as Nouns punk holders, in aspirations to collaborate and scale our collective ideas. This is a passion project, which we will relentlessly pursue until it comes into fruition.</p>
<p>As a team of two racially, and politically marginalized, doxxed women, we are expert professionals with diverse and essential experiences. We are joined by a consultant and expert professor and advisor, with whom collectively we have over 70 years of experience. We aspire to dedicate our lives to this project, establishing it in order to remain sustainable for generations to come.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for reviewing the following proposal. We look forward to hearing from you and the potential of a future collaboration.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>filmfund.eth</p>

<p>Kristina Weiserova                          Dr. Lemny Perez</p>
<p><strong>filmfund.eth Nouns DAO Proposal</strong></p>
<p>Proposal introduction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establishing filmfund.eth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pilot/first episode of first audiovisual project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clothing Collection (name to be determined, highlighting Nouns)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Kristina Weiserova (113kw) and Dr. Lemny Perez have collaborated for a joint social impact and film venture project.</p>
<p>As two under-resourced, educated and experienced women, we propose the following film fund to the Nouns DAO.</p>
<p>FILMFUND.ETH will primarily be funding film and film related projects by women, BIPOC and creatives, to include and target authors over 55 years of age. FILMFUND.ETH will be a DAO issued tokens with revenues from the distribution and screening of audiovisual projects funded by us. Detailed voting structures for selected projects, and planned ongoing and sustainable web3-film3 projects will be considered. We plan to ask for funding from multiple sources, with the major funding support from Nouns. Additionally, we propose to incorporate the Nouns DAO as a logo.</p>
<p>In order to divide this large goal into tangible objectives, our innitial aim is a proposal to fund the production of the first audio visual piece, a 50 minute episode, showing viewers how to apply and get funding from Nouns DAO. Also, we request financial support to establish the filmfund.eth DAO and for professional promotions of the overall project.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>To achieve the promotion of the Nouns DAO and upon the discretion of the DAO, we’ll prepare a website, and social media outlets to promote the filmfund.eth project. Lastly, we’d like to establish a corporate identity theme by Nouns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First deliverable: a 50 mins TV SERIES PILOT, as the first episode of a series. In this series, the viewer will see a doctor psychologist, as she is treating a myriad of clients. In the first episode the viewers encounter a story of two brothers. One of them finds out about Nouns, and receives funding for a project to make the world a more inclusive and better place. In the episode, we also see all Nouns merch already created, such as Nouns glasses, etc., that will be readily available for consumer consumption. This will be offered to Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime Video and decentralized streaming services. If accepted and upon the discretion of the DAO, we will produce more episodes upon viewers demand. If not accepted, we will distribute them independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second deliverable: Fashion garment collection highlighting Nouns, worn by actors in the pilot, recreated with emphasis on Nouns motives for general public sales. Created by hiring experienced designer of gypsy decent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michalmarek_atelier" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.instagram.com/michalmarek_atelier</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both deliverables will be promoted with specialized hired marketers (including specialized press marketers/communicators for American and international press) with an identified niche audience, keen to be interested in our content. Also, we are planning to promote pieces of footage from the first deliverable, sharing it on social media as part of the Nouns and filmfund.eth promo campaign, creating POAPs and web3 events. This is in efforts to create significant impact in the nft/crypto, web2/web1 and analog established media.</p>
<p>Next, we will proceed with creating FILMFUND.ETH DAO, where the first deliverable will be our reference for possible investors. FILMFUND.ETH DAO details are described in FILMFUND.ETH mission.</p>
<p>Please find below the budget for the deliverables:</p>

<p><strong>First Episode Storyline</strong></p>
<p>The series will tell the story of a psychologist and her journey with her patients. Each storyline episode depicts the protagonist and patients’ lives as they make significant changes while interfacing with crypto, Nouns and NFTs.</p>
<p>In the first episode/pilot produced, the audience is introduced to a pair of 20-year-old brothers. One is a “good guy” with dreams of doing good in the world. The audience is introduced to a storyline of how he learned about the Nouns ecosystem, and how he submits his Nouns proposal for funding a simple project compatible with Nouns values (TBD). We can see his dreams as a beautiful, animated sequence, where he is meeting Nouns and is interacting with them. The storylines are described in the treatment that was used for creating the budget. We will also see explained values and ethics that Nouns are presenting, including one actor playing the role of a Noun owner, plus a cameo episodic appearance (in case Noun owners are interested). We would like to present in the pilot, Noun related merchandise thus far created and our actors will be wearing clothing, specially designed as merchandise (trousers, hoodies, jackets, dress). In our budget, we are collaborating with renowned Czech post production company, <a href="https://www.upp.cz/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Universal Production Partners (UPP)</a>, who created the below video, to achieve the same level of visual effects as in this video - Meghan Thee Stallion Sweetest Pie (released recently) <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7JrX7PHGBE" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Megan Thee Stallion &amp; Dua Lipa - Sweetest Pie [Official Video] - YouTube</a></p>
<p><strong>Filmfund.eth Mission:</strong></p>
<p>We aim to be the driving force behind major impact and big change to encourage historically marginalized and oppressed populations. We intend to provide individuals and communities with visibility, vis a vis promoting a platform for non traditional voices to be heard on the global film/tv market. We aim to show the audience different points of view that are beyond a male’s and Anglo perspective of the world.</p>
<p>Because there is a huge disproportion of representation in this field, the majority of content in TV and cinemas is written and directed by Anglo men. Most bizarre are those films highlighting the perspectives of women, curated by men. As such, we aim to be a platform to change this huge disproportion by creating FILM FUND.ETH. Our objective is to provide dedicated support to ALL types of projects related to audiovisual storytelling through media by the aforementioned populations.</p>
<p>We aim to primarily work with organizations that support bipoc, women and people over 55 years of age. We have listed below potential collaborators.</p>

<li>During the year, participants would be supported with the progress of projects, and would be informed that in the event they do not fulfill delineated expectations, they might be asked to pay back part of the donation.</li>
<li>Each year would be supported by revenue collected from movies, and books, and projects like the metaverse museum, virtual film festival etc.</li>
<li>Revenues back to filmfund.eth DAO members would go from ticket sales, book sales, in case of tv pilot getting on Netflix, portion from that as well.</li>

<p>Hey, many great points in this proposal. Have you considered as a V0 to enroll to <a href="http://nounsfes.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nounsfes.org</a>? This project is aligned with your values, and it would be an easy way to showcase that you are a great team.</p>

<p>thank you very much for your feedback. at the moment I dont have financies to do shooting of content that would be eligible for being submitted in the project <a href="http://nounfes.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nounfes.org</a> which seems to be project targeted for younger creators, with less years of experiences than I have. At the moment my financial situation and the fact I am not student living with parents, prevents me from organizing any type of shooting for free “just to proove” other than shooting just myself talking on camera. There is maybe misunderstanding on your side of what the proposal is about. Our proposal is about 50 minutes project, first etap is writing detailed technical and dialogues script, that must be done in at least 14 versions with working together with payed proffesional dramaturgist. After this is another 3 month of preproduction work, booking places, actors, crew. After 25 days of shooting we will have raw material. With this raw material will be working editor, raw edit, clean edit, than UPP production adding special effects and animations according to script, for which they want to be payed, I can not hire them “just to show we are great team”. Than colorgrading, than music, sound effects postproduction. After this I will have footage to submit to such festival. Now I can provide only myself talking on camera.</p>

<p>if you re interrested what I have done for 13 000 dollars, than watch this. but it is older project, and I financed from my savings. we had 14 versions, technical script, hired crew, booked places and actors. We shooted 20 days. Raw material was edited, than clean edit. Added animations and effects and titles, as it is not in english (which I dont want to do now). Animations are ugly ( I didnt have financies for UPP level). Colorgrading was very pricey as it was done for screening in cinemas, huge size screen, means I have it as equvalent of 35 mm film but digital = special hard disk for screening in cinemas). Music from various composers, original classic music composed , mix of dialogues, sound effects and music together. After this the movie is like that: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWWbGC0EKCk" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ROOTS IN EGO / Kde se v lidech bere zlo? - FULL MOVIE ONLINE - YouTube</a></p>

<p>Thank you for the link. I will watch later. I live in Prague so I am looking forward to watch it.<br/>
Your team has a lot of experience in the industry, what would be the best way to have a bunch of submissions to <a href="http://nounsfes.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nounsfes.org</a>? Could you forward the page to people who are susceptible to submitting a short film?</p>

<p>yes, deffinitely! we will actualy be adding a little more informations and small change in the proposal, to show more of team. We can help with promo of <a href="http://nounfes.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nounfes.org</a>  . 1. students on film school - it is pity, they have already end of scholar year. should be submitted to film students all around world, for example FAMU university in Prague etc, but as I mentioned, it is pity, it is already end of the year for students and they have vacations now. So probably will not check university announcements so often as during year. 2. I woudl suggest promo within web3- we have contacts since beggining of year 2021. We are connected with discords gathering people interrested in film3 topic, there are regular twitter spaces where this should be promoted etc. Even our filmfund.eth already gathered around 50 followers/people from film3 environment.</p>

<p>Dear Nouns DAO,</p>
<p>We have made couple changes, we believe for better. We are pleased to meet your formal acquaintance and respectfully propose the following. Kristina Weiserova and Kimani Okereah realized they had simmilar ideas in their mind, and found out it is best to put together their experiences and powers for project filmfund.eth. Both of us are passionate about film making business, but both cant realy do our dreams, because to do them, we need funding. And Kristina is not trusted with big projects because she is woman, while Kimani didnt get his big chance yet maybe because of him being Afro American and Native American descent. Our project is not only funding our dream, but also building foundation for others like us, so they can also achieve their film related dreams. There is a huge disproportion in film business, and for people like us is close to impossible to get chance to do big projects, no matter how hard we try. This proposal is our passion project, which we will relentlessly pursue until it comes into fruition.</p>
<p>As a team of two racially, and politically marginalized, doxxed people, we are expert professionals with diverse and essential experiences. We are joined by a consultant and expert professor and advisor, with whom collectively we have over 60 years of experience. We aspire to dedicate our lives to this project, establishing it in order to remain sustainable for generations to come.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for reviewing the following proposal. We look forward to hearing from you and the potential of a future collaboration.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>filmfund.eth</p>

<p>FILMFUND.ETH will be a DAO issued tokens with revenues from the distribution and screening of audiovisual projects funded by us. Detailed voting structures for selected projects, and planned ongoing and sustainable web3-film3 projects will be considered. We plan to ask for funding from multiple sources, with the major funding support from Nouns. Additionally, we propose to incorporate the Nouns DAO as a logo.</p>
<p>In order to divide this large goal into tangible objectives, our innitial aim is a proposal to fund the production of the first audio visual piece, a 50 minute episode, showing viewers how to apply and get funding from Nouns DAO. Also, we request financial support to establish the filmfund.eth DAO and for professional promotions of the overall project.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>To achieve the promotion of the Nouns DAO and upon the discretion of the DAO, we’ll prepare a website, and social media outlets to promote the filmfund.eth project. Lastly, we’d like to establish a corporate identity theme by Nouns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First deliverable: a 50 mins TV SERIES PILOT, as the first episode of a series. In this series, the viewer will see a doctor psychologist, as she is treating a myriad of clients. In the first episode the viewers encounter a story of two brothers. One of them finds out about Nouns, and receives funding for a project to make the world a more inclusive and better place. In the episode, we also see all Nouns merch already created, such as Nouns glasses, etc., that will be readily available for consumer consumption. This will be offered to Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime Video and decentralized streaming services. If accepted and upon the discretion of the DAO, we will produce more episodes upon viewers demand. If not accepted, we will distribute them independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second deliverable: NOUNS by Michal Marek. Fashion garment collection highlighting Nouns and their ethics, worn by actors in the pilot, recreated with emphasis on Nouns motives for general public sales. Created by hiring experienced designer of gypsy decent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michalmarek_atelier" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.instagram.com/michalmarek_atelier</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third deliverable: Documentary 45 minutes about Afroamerican NFT artist Eearplug, metaverse aechitect, oil paintings, cryptovoxels wearable builder. In documentary would be presented his metaverse parcels and designs, some of which connected and inspired by Nouns and Noun related collections. Part of documentary will also be visiting Nouns DAO parcels in Cryptovoxels and presenting what was build by Nouns DAO related creators so far. We have contacts for Cryptovoxels team, so we can expect support with promo of such documentary. (Cryptovoxels has recently changed name to Voxels, we are still mentioning old name. ) Interview with Eearplug <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kyyrde-JT8" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">(708) HOTINRI INTERVIEWS PAINTER EVIZIONZ DESIGN - YouTube</a> <a href="https://linktr.ee/EEAR_PLUG" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">CREATIVE INSOMNIA | Linktree</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All deliverables will be promoted with specialized hired marketers (including specialized press marketers/communicators for American and international press) with an identified niche audience, keen to be interested in our content. Also, we are planning to promote pieces of footage from the first deliverable, sharing it on social media as part of the Nouns and filmfund.eth promo campaign, creating POAPs and web3 events. This is in efforts to create significant impact in the nft/crypto, web2/web1 and analog established media.</p>
<p>Next, we will proceed with creating NOUNS FILMFUND.ETH DAO, where the first deliverables will be our references for possible investors. FILMFUND.ETH DAO details are described in FILMFUND.ETH mission.</p>
<p>Please find below the budget for the deliverables:</p>

<p><strong>First Episode Storyline</strong></p>
<p>The series will tell the story of a psychologist and her journey with her patients. Each storyline episode depicts the protagonist and patients’ lives as they make significant changes while interfacing with crypto, Nouns and NFTs.</p>
<p>In the first episode/pilot produced, the audience is introduced to a pair of 20-year-old brothers. One is a “good guy” with dreams of doing good in the world. The audience is introduced to a storyline of how he learned about the Nouns ecosystem, and how he submits his Nouns proposal for funding a simple project compatible with Nouns values (TBD). We can see his dreams as a beautiful, animated sequence, where he is meeting Nouns and is interacting with them. The storylines are described in the treatment that was used for creating the budget. We will also see explained values and ethics that Nouns are presenting, including one actor playing the role of a Noun owner, plus a cameo episodic appearance (in case Noun owners are interested). We would like to present in the pilot, Noun related merchandise thus far created and our actors will be wearing clothing, specially designed as merchandise (trousers, hoodies, jackets, dress). In our budget, we are collaborating with renowned Czech post production company, <a href="https://www.upp.cz/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Universal Production Partners (UPP)</a>, who created the below video, to achieve the same level of visual effects as in this video - Meghan Thee Stallion Sweetest Pie (released recently) <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7JrX7PHGBE" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Megan Thee Stallion &amp; Dua Lipa - Sweetest Pie [Official Video] - YouTube</a></p>
<p><strong>Filmfund.eth Mission:</strong></p>
<p>We aim to be the driving force behind major impact and big change to encourage historically marginalized and oppressed populations. We intend to provide individuals and communities with visibility, vis a vis promoting a platform for non traditional voices to be heard on the global film/tv market. We aim to show the audience different points of view that are beyond a male’s and Anglo perspective of the world.</p>
<p>Because there is a huge disproportion of representation in this field, the majority of content in TV and cinemas is written and directed by Anglo men. Most bizarre are those films highlighting the perspectives of women, curated by men. As such, we aim to be a platform to change this huge disproportion by creating NOUNS BRANDED FILM FUND.ETH. Our objective is to provide dedicated support to ALL types of projects related to audiovisual storytelling through media by the aforementioned populations.</p>
<p>(Upon questions, details regards voting of submissions to filmfund will be added shortly after language correction of the article.)</p>
<p>We aim to primarily work with organizations that support bipoc, women and people over 55 years of age. We have listed below potential collaborators.</p>

<p><strong>Roadmap DAO:</strong></p>
<p>The first stage (year 1)</p>
<ul>
<li>FILMFUND.ETH DAO</li>
<li>Delivering documentary about cryptovoxels metaverse creator featuring Nouns DAO parcels</li>
<li>Delivering first pilot of serie</li>
<li>Clothing line
<ul>
<li>Leveraged to promote FILMFUND.ETH DAO and NOUNs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second stage (year 2)</p>
<ul>
<li>Support the first 3 projects from the public
<ul>
<li>All have to be on the topic of Nouns, NFT and crypto.</li>
<li>movies be selected in order to keep it totally transparent and fair:
<ul>
<li>DAO will vote people in a jury, professionals from film industry, with experiences in film juries 5-25 years, representing different age, gender and race groups.</li>
<li>These professionals will select from submissions 5 movies from which DAO will vote 3 that will be supported.</li>
<li>Movies can be: short film, debut film, full length film, television series pilots, documentary film, animated film, film museum, film festival, film science book publishing) (we are not supporting youtube/ tiktok channels. If they have a good enough idea, they must write a project of bigger size and submit it to us).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One book publishing under NOUNs + FILM FUND. ETH brand
<ul>
<li>Book is about history and the process of change between analog movie effects into today’s 3D CGI effects in movies</li>
<li>Already worked on by consultant/advisor, professor from film university, our consultant and adviser doc. Mgr. Antonin Weiser ACK.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metaverse events with POAPs
<ul>
<li>Metaverse event with the selection of audiovisual artists, (not only) from oppressed groups, promoting and highlighting NOUNs and FILMFUND.ETH (we are POAP creators since beggining of 2021, first POAP in Czech republic)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The aforementioned in Stage 2 will be financed by another proposal to Noun DAO and by either NFT collection (not pfps but still frames from the movie) or release of fungible tokens - upon consultations.</p>
<p>Holders of Nouns, specific NFTs from filmfund.eth collection or certain amount of fungible tokens would have utilities in forms of portions of revenues from movies and book, and voting in DAO - more to be added upon consultation.</p>
<p>We would like to continue supporting projects every year.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the year, participants would be supported with the progress of projects, and would be informed that in the event they do not fulfill delineated expectations, they might be asked to pay back part of the donation.</li>
<li>Each year would be supported by revenue collected from movies, and books, and projects like the metaverse museum, virtual film festival etc.</li>
<li>Revenues back to filmfund.eth DAO members and NOUNS DAO, would go from ticket sales, book sales, in case of tv pilot getting on Netflix, portion from that as well. <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/k8rHwQogliRXnXhDzpEroj2NgaY.jpeg?dl=1" href="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/original/2X/8/8d1fea61c2f1454fd34984648e3cc99c79e250a0.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" title=""><img alt="" data-base62-sha1="k8rHwQogliRXnXhDzpEroj2NgaY" data-small-upload="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/8/8d1fea61c2f1454fd34984648e3cc99c79e250a0_2_10x10.png" height="167" src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/8/8d1fea61c2f1454fd34984648e3cc99c79e250a0_2_167x167.jpeg" srcset="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/8/8d1fea61c2f1454fd34984648e3cc99c79e250a0_2_167x167.jpeg, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/8/8d1fea61c2f1454fd34984648e3cc99c79e250a0_2_250x250.jpeg 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/8/8d1fea61c2f1454fd34984648e3cc99c79e250a0_2_334x334.jpeg 2x" width="167"/><div class="meta">

<p><strong>Justification</strong>:</p>
<p>Not only we want to be part of Nouns DAO and bring NOUNs DAO story to general public audience knowledge, and doing so with 2 audiovisual projects + fashion line, that would be professionally promoted. We also want to provide to others like us, so they also have the possibility to achieve their film related dreams aswell. Historically, women, and people of color and individuals over the age of 55 are missing from the narratives of film, web3 and the world in media at large. We aim to provide multiple media platforms and systems to change this occurrence. In regards to the budget, quotes and estimates are detailed according to our script and experience of the filmmaking business, towards the quality of production that we aspire to achieve for the Nouns DAO.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline: 2022 - 2023</strong></p>
<p>Q&amp;A: 113KW and Kimani Okereah will make themselves available for Q&amp;A in the Nouns Discord,Twitter Spaces and on a Nouners call as needed. Mr.</p>
<p>Detailed CVs for the Filmfund.eth founders can be provided upon request, same as detailed script of the pilot.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Clubnotaro.eth</span> + <span class="mention">@noun22</span> we had to change our proposal due to health reasons of Dr. Lemny. Another member of our wider team stepped up in her position, and we also made a change in deliverables. Because <span class="mention">@Clubnotaro.eth</span> mentioned <a href="http://nounfes.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nounfes.org</a> we decided to add documentary, that we are able to produce within 3 months after receiving funding and therefore could be guick submission from us to <a href="http://nounfes.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">nounfes.org</a> .  Documentary would show to viewers and general public life story of AfroAmerican Cryptovoxels builder / more details:  Documentary 45 minutes about Afroamerican NFT artist Eearplug, metaverse aechitect, oil paintings, cryptovoxels wearable builder. In documentary would be presented his metaverse parcels and designs, some of which connected and inspired by Nouns and Noun related collections. Part of documentary will also be visiting Nouns DAO parcels in Cryptovoxels and presenting what was build by Nouns DAO related creators so far. We have contacts for Cryptovoxels team, so we can expect support with promo of such documentary. (Cryptovoxels has recently changed name to Voxels, we are still mentioning old name. ) Who is Eearplug - interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kyyrde-JT8" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">(708) HOTINRI INTERVIEWS PAINTER EVIZIONZ DESIGN - YouTube</a></p>

<p>thank you very much. it was difficult for me to because we didnt have enough budget back than. I wish for years to be able to film with proper budget but the closest I got to this, was me being offered my script being taken from me, and give to a male director to direct it. which felt to me like someone taking my baby. we also reacted to your comment with nounfes, and decided to add another deliverable, which would present cryptovoxels metaverse architect, and we would love to add presentation of cryptovoxels parcels and wearables that were already created for NOUNs (I visited the other day, they are beautiful). As we also know cryptovoxels team, and me being hobby cryptovoxels builder aswell, we think it can be quick and fresh audiovisual piece, presenting decentralized metaverse to general public thru one individuals interresting life story. Subject of document also plans to create more art inspired by NOUNs aswell. I hope you like this idea!</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the thoughtful proposal. This seems like a great cause but this has very little to do with Nouns separate from a small tie in / sponsorship and I do not think it justifies the sizable fund ask</p>

<p>thank you for your reaction. I would admit, that the story of the pilot is supposed to be showing NOUNS ethics, morals, and presenting to viewer a story about how one person founds out about NOUNS DAO and succesfully submits, get funding and realizes their project with significant humanity positive aspect. alongside with showing a character that is “NOUN owner” and all this with use of highest quality special effects in dream scenes. the documentary is presenting what does it mean to be a cryptovoxels metaverse and wearables builder and NOUNs parcels in cryptovoxels. all this to be proffesionaly promoted, meaning press releases, social media campaign, plus submitting to numerous distribution services. filmfund.eth would forever be presenting NOUNs values and further promoting whole nouniverse sustainably. According to my experiences with proffesional media and promo services, that will have the biggest impact on wider public. In case the pilot being accepted will then be produced whole serie showing each episode different sides of NOUNs universe. may I ask you <span class="mention">@noun22</span> if you would recomend us rather trying to find additional funding and having this proposal only partial for the budget we need? than we can imagine having in the storyline also maybe other collections ? if you can maybe guide me. thank you.</p>

<p>I also realized, maybe it is not clear from proposal, in case I can try prepare diagram, but the idea is that  revenues from audiovisual pieces and their streaming (in case accepted to Netflix etc) are going partialy back to NOUNS DAO plus NOUNS owners can vote in filmfund proposals. So thats another way how to give back and be valuable for NOUNS, besides the fact of showing the ecosystem on example of storyline of one of main characters, who is submitting proposal to NOUNS DAO in the story and succeeds. biggest portion of budget is located for proffesional postproduction that will be on this level from same post production studio which priced our project as it is in budget. this level of animations and postproduction as example of video they did : <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7JrX7PHGBE" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Megan Thee Stallion &amp; Dua Lipa - Sweetest Pie [Official Video] - YouTube</a>  which the footage would be than further used for proffesional promotion of NOUNS on social medias, and traditional medias.</p>

<p>Long story short, this is NounsDAO building a bridge into one of the largest revenue-producing industries in the world. The USA alone produced a $49b trade surplus in intellectual property… and we know how many failed projects get made. That’s a $49b surplus with very little quality control.</p>
<p>Kristina has designed this bridge for NounsDAO, and for a low-cost. The $ behind the proposal is a very efficient budget, and both Kristina and I have become experts over the years at producing quality results with little overhead.</p>
<p>I’m an Afro-Indigenous person myself, though I personally don’t believe that presenting stories through a lens of persecution has a healing impact on society. I appreciate the space and attention given to my experiences with marginalization, but my goal is to build a bridge to understanding.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>NounsDAO seeds FilmFund.eth, a project by Kristina Weiserova, member of NounsDAO. My suggestion is to award the full proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FilmFund.eth produces a Pilot for a series surrounding web3 financing, the first narrative of it’s kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Pilot explores journeys of characters as they venture into web3, with the character journey leading them to NounsDAO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the natural cinematic landscape of the story, NounsDAO exists. No cheap insertions, no throw-aways. NounsDAO is a fundamental part of this storyworld and adventure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My LMO Structure allows all parties involved to adequately split rights and revenue streams, if applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s my suggestion to Kristina to arrange a series of prompts for this content, and let NounsDAO members help in the creation of the story and the journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am here as an advisor and a 15-year film industry professional, in support of Kristina, one of the original web3 producers in this new wave of film/tv production.<br/>
Finally…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proposal she’s asking for is one noodle in a pot of spaghetti, compared to traditional industry. I’d insist on determining NounsDAO ROI ahead of any actions, but past that, I think there’s a return on this for the DAO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financing a member project… that’s literally a cinematic presentation of a character discovering web3, NounsDAO, and getting their project financed… Do I really need to spell out how efficient that is?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
