<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Leveraging Ceramic.network, we will improve the accessibility, usability and value of data in the Nouniverse, providing users with greater control and ownership over their data through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs), enabling interoperability and composability of data across different applications. During this process, our deliverable will simultaneously mitigate some challenges with data fragmentation, while improving data availability, data composability, and establishing the foundation for universal identity within the Nouniverse.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#problem-statement-1" name="problem-statement-1"></a>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>As the DAO grows, people must navigate an environment that is increasingly fragmented. The data produced by many small and large applications are scattered, siloed and inconsistent in format and structure, making it difficult for users to access and utilize. This fragmentation lowers the accessibility, usability, and value of the data, and limits the potential insights and innovations that can be gained from it.</p>
<p>In addition, only a small subset of all data in the Nouniverse is stored on-chain, which can create challenges for developers and users who need to access and use this data. In a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), data is a critical asset that drives decision-making, governance, and value creation. Therefore, it is important for a DAO to have a decentralized data network like Ceramic that provides users with greater control and ownership of their data, and enables interoperability and composability of data across different applications, including off-chain data.</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>: In a future wherein permissionless data collaboration achieves critical mass within the DAO, users would have unprecedented control and ownership over their data, with the ability to easily share and reuse it across different participating applications. The decentralized nature of Ceramic would ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently, without the risk of censorship or centralization. The interoperability and composability enabled by Ceramic would lead to a proliferation of innovative and user-centric applications, breaking down the barriers that currently exist between different platforms and ecosystems. The benefits of this future would extend beyond just the technical members of the DAO, as all users would be able to take advantage of the seamless and intuitive interfaces enabled by the data network. The adoption of Ceramic would be a major step towards a more open and equitable internet, where data is treated as a commons to be shared and nurtured, rather than a commodity to be monetized and controlled.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#objectives-2" name="objectives-2"></a>Objectives</h2>
<ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#deliverables-4-month-timeline-3" name="deliverables-4-month-timeline-3"></a>Deliverables - 4 Month Timeline</h2>
<p>To achieve these objectives, we will deliver the following components: infrastructure, applications, and services.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: The infrastructure component involves deploying a Ceramic network node that runs an instance of ComposeDB, the decentralized, composable graph database. This node will serve the applications, which can read and write data permissionlessly (subject to data ownership constraints). The raw data backing this database is stored in a separate IPFS node. In order to bootstrap application use cases, relevant on-chain and off-chain data will be imported, processed and stored into ComposeDB. The data will be attributed with relationships for composability and made available via a GraphQL API.</p>
<p><strong>Applications</strong>: Three applications will be deployed on the Ceramic network by the core team upon completion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>NounsID</strong> - The identity interface for the Nouniverse. Aims to address the challenge of data fragmentation, while improving data availability, data composability, and establishing the foundation for a permissionless, composable, universal identity. This identity layer, will enable greater control and ownership over user data through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs), enabling interoperability and composability of data across different applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Builder Profile</strong> - Builder profiles (nounish.cv) are meant to give a full picture of a nounish builder’s contributions to the Nouniverse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Noundry</strong> - Will integrate with the Ceramic network, leveraging its decentralized datastore, and our universal identity (NounsID). Noundry Ceramic Integration may include but are not limited by the following features:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Upload your traits once, use it all across the ecosystem! - Create your artist profile and keep your own provenance records - Include metadata with your artwork. Give it name &amp; context.</li>
<li>Remix &amp; collab on everything, powered by CC0 Some ideas of integrations to harness this data:</li>
<li>Noundry contests, to sign up your traits and try to make them into official Nouns traits.</li>
<li>Builder DAO, to boot a new DAO with Nounish artwork using a collection of existing traits.</li>
<li>Noun DAO UIs, to show tooltips over the Nouns with more info about the traits and their artists</li>
<li>Other features to explore: cross-dao artwork compatibility by mapping out trait categories, templates, sizes &amp; color palettes - Scraping of existing artwork and contacting artists to seed their profiles - Offering the artwork in multiple formats (svg, png) for better compatibility with different applications</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The team will also reserve part of the funding to sponsor a Prop House round for applications developers.</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughout development, the team will provide weekly Q&amp;A during office hours, hosted by The Noun Square.</li>
<li>The team will provide a JavaScript library that makes it easy for front-end applications to query and deploy their own data.</li>
<li>Finally, we will collaborate with AI Pod, providing the processed and formatted data relevant for training their models.</li>
</ul>
