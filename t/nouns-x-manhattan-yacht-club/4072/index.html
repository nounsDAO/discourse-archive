<strong>Requested Support</strong>
</li>
<li>Nouns branded t-shirts &amp; caps for sailors, guests, and spectators. Sailors are not particularly good at making cool clothing. The Manhattan Yacht Club hopes that NounsDAO would make cool merchandise that everyone loves.</li>
<li>Hire two photographers. Photos/videos will be branded with Noggles and distributed to the regatta participants to share on sns. The photos would create a meaningful online and offline presence. This is one more step towards making nouns a pop culture brand.</li>

<a class="anchor" href="#description-3" name="description-3"></a>Description</h2>
<p>Manhattan Yacht Club (MYC) and The New York Harbor Sailing Foundation have a vision to build a sailing platform that can introduce more newyorkers to sport of sailing. The Club and the Foundation believe that there are enough people in New York who want to go sailing at least once a year. The long term vision is to grow Twelve Meter Heritage regatta every year and make a week long sailing festival in the future.</p>
<p>Manhattan Yacht Club (MYC) is looking for a sponsor who would help to grow and promote Twelve Meter Heritage Regatta. MYC is asking for media support such as photography and drone footage. Also, MYC wants to distribute t-shirts and caps to the guests.</p>
<p>The Manhattan Yacht Club is the largest and most active sailing organization in New York Harbor. The Club embodies the spirit of openness and inclusivity. Manhattan Yacht Club re-introduced recreational sailing to New York Harbor in 1987 and have connections with more than 32 Yacht Clubs around the world <a href="https://myc.org/club/reciprocal/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">(Reciprocal Foreign Yacht Clubs)</a>.</p>
<p>Manhattan Yacht Club has a long history of hosting sailing events and is looking for sponsors for the <a href="https://myc.org/12-meter-heritage-regatta/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Twelve Meter Heritage Regatta</a>. The event is sponsored by <a href="https://nyharborsailing.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The New York Harbor Sailing Foundation Inc</a>. The Foundation is a non-profit corporation which promotes amateur events of national and international importance. This is why the Twelve Meter Regatta is an important event. The Twelve meter class has many loyal fans in USA and around the world, especially in the Mediterranean countries such as France, Italy, Monaco and many others.</p>
<p><a href="https://myc.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Manhattan Yacht Club</a> serves as the Race Committee for the event. This year, the format of the regatta is changed and more people would be able to participate in sailing and watch the event from spectator boats. There will be four Twelve Meter boats welcoming guests plus spectator boats.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#long-term-collaboration-4" name="long-term-collaboration-4"></a>Long term collaboration</h2>
<p>This is a great opportunity for NounsDAO to establish a long lasting relationship with Manhattan Yacht Club and NY Harbor Sailing Foundation. New York is home to many famous people, companies, and festivals. NounsDAO would be able to promote noggles, tell story of Nouns, onboard new people, and create global visibility.</p>
<p>By sponsoring the regatta, NousDAO would reach various demographic groups international and gain exposure that would capture attention on social networks and further proliferate NounsDAO.</p>
<p>The Nouns sponsorship would help Manhattan Yacht Club, NY Harbor Sailing Foundation, and sailing teams to cover some of the logistics expenses. In return, the Nouns would be able to create visibility and engage with guests.</p>
