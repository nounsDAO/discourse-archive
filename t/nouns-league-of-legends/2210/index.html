<p>Hello, my name is Griff. As a huge fan of competitive gaming and a long-term esports operator I became nouns-pilled by Sasquatch when he started the DotA 2 team.  Since then, I have been actively involved in Nouns Esports as a member of the pod.</p>
<p>Below is an <a href="https://twitter.com/1fortytwo/status/1562143172930723842" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“audacious proposal”</a> (thank you 142!) from myself and other highly experienced esports operators.  We are excited to receive your feedback.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#goal-1" name="goal-1"></a><strong>Goal</strong></h3>
<p>This proposal will help Nouns become a top global brand in the gaming industry. Specifically, our goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To proliferate Nouns via the most viewed esports title in the world, League of Legends.</li>
<li>To build a team out of Australia the can qualify and compete at global events from within the League of Legends Circuit Oceania.
<ul>
<li>Further referred to as the ‘LCO’ for the remainder of the proposal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To create a sustainable esport initiative on a two year timeline.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#description-2" name="description-2"></a><strong>Description</strong></h3>
<p>By installing a team in Australia’s LCO for the next 2 years, Nouns will have an opportunity to build a sustainable foundation around the largest game in competitive gaming.</p>

<h3><a class="anchor" href="#wildcard-gaming-past-accolades-in-league-14" name="wildcard-gaming-past-accolades-in-league-14"></a><strong>Wildcard Gaming - Past accolades in League</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Wildcard_Gaming" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Wildcard Gaming</a> has an extensive history within League of Legends inside North America. We have been the launching pad for many of today’s top players and staff such as: Blabber (Cloud 9), ic0nic (Golden Guardians), Dhokla (CLG), Bradley (Team Liquid Academy), Kayys (TSM Head Scout and Strategic Coach), and Myra Davis (CLG Faith Manager). We also had the unique opportunity to work closely with Paramount Studios in 2021 while they recorded the show <em>‘Players’</em> since our player Noh ‘Arrow’ Dong-hyeon was selected for a role in the show. We are familiar with the Riot Team that manages North America and oversees Oceania; and have a longstanding and collegial working relationship with them.</p>
<p>In the 2021 Summer Split, Wildcard Gaming won all three Path to Pro Tournaments and earned the highest seed for non-franchised teams. In the postseason tournament, Wildcard defeated multiple high level teams and ultimately lost to 100 Thieves Academy, the eventual tournament champions.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#competitive-structure-15" name="competitive-structure-15"></a><strong>Competitive Structure</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Australia currently operates as a talent farm for North America.  This is because the OCE region does not count as an import slot towards LCS rosters.  With Wildcard’s unique understanding of the North American and Australian esport markets, we are uniquely positioned to properly source talent. To give Nouns a competitive advantage in the region we plan to target top Australian talent and pair them with high-end imported players from around the world.</li>
<li>Through the Wildcard operating teams vast connections and understanding of talent we will be hand picking the best available players that fit the budget. These players will also fit the style of play and culture most conducive to a positive winning environment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Support Staff:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will source a Head Coach, Analyst and other necessary staff to best support the players.</li>
</ul>

<li>Travel/Visas - 15 ETH</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#revenue-18" name="revenue-18"></a><strong>Revenue</strong></h3>
<p>League of Legends is the most desired esport for endemic and non-endemic partners due to its popularity amongst multiple demographics while being one of the most brand safe games in the esports industry.</p>
<p>Wildcard has been in operation since 2017.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wildcard already operates teams in
<ul>
<li>Rainbow Six: Siege (Australia)</li>
<li>DotA 2 (North America)</li>
<li>Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds (North America)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a League of Legends roster to this marketable esports package allows us to source sponsorship deals at a higher value and we have proposed the following revenue split to work towards making League of Legends self sufficient in a two-year timeline.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" href="#proposed-partnership-revenue-breakdown-19" name="proposed-partnership-revenue-breakdown-19"></a><strong>Proposed Partnership Revenue Breakdown</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Wildcard partnerships that also include the Nouns League of Legends:
<ul>
<li>80% Wildcard 20% Nouns esport treasury.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>League of Legends or Nouns esport specific partnerships curated by Wildcard:
<ul>
<li>80% Nouns esport treasury 20% Wildcard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any potential-partnership deal that would include Nouns League of Legends as a deliverable, would be disclosed to Nouns, and Nouns would have the ability to refuse any agreement that involves Nouns.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="anchor" href="#two-year-transition-20" name="two-year-transition-20"></a><strong>Two Year Transition</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>After two years we believe the League team will be self-sustaining via revenue streams such as partnerships, league revenue share, merchandising and player buy-outs.
<ul>
<li>In this situation Nouns has the opportunity to renew branding rights on a per year basis at no renewal cost.  If the League team is still running at a deficit, Nouns has the ability to renew branding rights at a 50% operating cost, split with Wildcard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If Wildcard decides to sell their LCO League slot, Nouns has first right to purchase at current market value.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#future-21" name="future-21"></a><strong>Future</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Wildcard operating team for Nouns League of Legends prop would be an entry point in working together on esport initiatives.</li>
<li>Funding would allow us to further integrate our operating team and consulting on Nouns esports initiatives.</li>
<li>We want to create a sustainable esport ecosystem for Nouns through monetization strategies such as sponsorship, strategic partnerships, in game sales, product and merchandise among others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Funding this proposal expands the potential for Nouns Esports. The Nouns brand resonates perfectly inside esport communities which thrive off meme content.  We believe that with a good vision and proper execution, Nouns esports has all the potential to become just as valuable as the most popular esport brands today, some of which are valued at over $100 million. Nouns League of Legends is a great next step into propelling Nouns esports to hitting this potential.</p>

<p>I’m hoping my comment will help bump this and get seen by more people. I’m not very familiar with how to quantify these kinds of props, but I know LOL is a really big deal. Have you ever looked into the previous esports props? They have a large capable team that would probably be very willing to bring in interested people and look at combining efforts once the current ‘season’ of prop money runs out.</p>
<p>Here’s the last prop for reference: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://nouns.wtf/vote/119">Nouns DAO</a></p>
<p>You can of course keep it moving forward on your own, but I bet <span class="mention">@maty</span> and the team would be very helpful for something like this.</p>
