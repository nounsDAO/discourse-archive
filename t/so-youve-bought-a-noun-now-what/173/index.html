<p><span class="mention">@4Skin</span> brought up a good point: what’s the best way to get involved and where should a newly minted Noun owner go?</p>
<p><code>#nounsdao</code> is the Discord discussion area and obviously Discourse is our long form discussion area but we’re missing a quick start guide for Nowners.</p>
<p>Let’s use this thread to discuss a high level view of the different things a Noun owner should expect to see, do, and interact with. Once we have a good overview I think it’d be fun if each of the frontends put their own spin on displaying the guide. For <code>nouns.wtf</code> we could have a special “now what” section when the Noun owner wins their auction/is viewing their Noun.</p>
<p>Topics that jump to mind for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to get in touch with other Noun owners</li>
<li>How do proposals work mechanically (on-chain voting, execution, etc)</li>
<li>How to view the proposals that are in flight or have recently been voted on</li>
<li>Location of draft proposals</li>
<li>What’s expected of Noun owners</li>
<li>Getting verified</li>
</ul>

<p>Agree that it would be nice to have a welcoming onboarding to get noun owners up to speed on how to engage and contribute.</p>
