<p>Nouns need far more in development for everyone to see this a trend as product with capable of acquiring the current trend.<br/>
I think first this needs to be a product of use case currently this is built on blockchain so apart from the blockchain community other should see the potential.<br/>
The best solution for it to become popular is to use in proper development strategies like for instance all popular accessories like noggles etc are popular through movies and short films trying that won’t work all the time cause it needs some element to it to be popular for example tom and Jerry got popular because of the jokes and funny play between a mouse and cat with a dog(not all the time.<br/>
The best way to improve the development with my research for this trend would be<br/>

<p>A radical solution would be <em>games</em> <strong>but in more an approach to the current trend not blockchain cause blockchain needs more people adoption</strong>. <strong>This could be a part of the game but not the entry to gaming.</strong><br/>
We need to acquire the gaming industry with the different approaches like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily playable (All different ages involved in game).</li>
<li>More innovative.</li>
<li>Incentivize the community (Reward in what make the game to next level).</li>
</ul>
<p>I choose the gaming side cause nouns movies and comics need better scene (explained earlier) also it is in development don’t want to make changes but a more suitable and innovative solution<br/>
gaming industry can be more innovative compared to comics, this generation loves innovation and technology,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>science based survey says games are more better and selected by individuals of all ages compared to stories and comics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.<br/>
Do we need a survey for this question?<br/>
No, of course this is the result you would have expected unless you are from the B.C’s <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=12" title=":smile:" width="20"/><br/>
But it should not be an old versions of games, A innovative version that will make nouns and noggles a part of history. Just like i wanted it to be one of the best cause of pixel art and the noggles.<br/>
I will be with the team for the end of my tech journey which is my whole life and develop most of my products integrated with nouns.</p>

<p>Yes! Agreed. We need to integrate into easily accessible and populist mainstream media outputs, like you suggest very accessible games, all ages not necessarily on-chain.<br/>
On-chain data, community tools and new forms of Open IP are a critical point in human evolution but are not yet mainstream and people do not quite understand the value proposition. Too many friction points.</p>

<p>Yes, the game should be mainstream media output making it accessible for everyone but <em>different from other mainstream media games</em> for <strong>instance rewards make it popular, etc</strong>. also with features that are good making it <strong>boasting and slight tactics</strong> used for an example rain world game.  .</p>

<p>We need to come through some criteria’s to <em>understand the problem</em> and <em><strong>create a reliable solution (strategy)</strong></em>:<br/>
<strong>1. What is the problem for Nounsdao.</strong><br/>
<strong>2. Why the problem is not improved (Current structure) and solution.</strong><br/>
<strong>3. Who need to try the plan to work out.</strong><br/>
<strong>4. Where does the problem need more effective and strategical solution.</strong><br/>
<strong>5. When will the implementation take place.</strong><br/>
<strong>6. How will this benefit the community.</strong></p>
<p>If this is found and solved we might get to the brand acquisition phase, noggles will become the trend.<br/>
All projects working on any project should consist this formula so this will take eliminate waste cost from treasure and make the ideas more effective.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Ideas can be generated by anybody but trustful and secure funding for the correct person who is doxxed or well known is important.</strong></p>

<p>I think that the means of destroying culture are suitable for mass acceptance and popularization. Basically, you could print a small comic and sell it (I can just give it away) in local stores.</p>
<p>Make limited editions and it will spur the interest of ordinary people.</p>

<p>I think your solution is an already existing one and it doesn’t solve anything (It isn’t a Problem to solve currently), you mentioned to provide guidance, you think that only stands to solve and pass your proposal also the budget is to much for a four-day old in the nouns community member and it is fake in all angles of your presentation.<br/>
Solving a problem in the Nouns Community doesn’t always mean you should have Big or Low Budget Sometimes a little from (Very Low) the treasury and a self-sustaining system (<strong>Zero Budget System</strong>) is great.<br/>
Aimimg for High Budget for an existing solution that are more effective that yours, well that is over for you.</p>

If you are so passionate to build something, then build it effective and efficient from others</p>

<p>Hey Nouns4155,</p>
<p>Thank you for your idea!! I really appreciate it!</p>
<p>I’m sorry that my account raised your questions, well also the amount I tried to acquire. Please let me clarify that I applied the fund in a one-year-stream and the Nouncils can terminate it any time, so the power is balanced, and the goals are aligned to build this product together without anyone can do harm. I know there are lots of cons in this field, so I’l willing to address any question any one raises.</p>
<p>As to the Zero Budget System you mentioned, I would call it Minimum Viable Product, I already finished the MVP in past years, using free tech stacks like CEX+API+spreadsheets to help onboard newbies and it proved such product will significantly increase newbie’s onboarding rate by 10x, so I know it is be a good time to ship the product (before this bull run). I’m confused why the presentation is fake in all angles, and no hard feelings, I would love to discuss.</p>
<p>Your last question is there is an existing solution, would you mind give me a link so I can research on? That would be super helpful, thank you <span class="mention">@Nouns4155</span>!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>
Andrew</p>

<p>Hey Mate, the budget you requested is too high for a platform that is similar to some of the major exchanges <strong>(ex. Binance Safepal Ledger etc)</strong> are doing more effectively and the idea is good (Solution) not that your idea is bad but i think it is not viable solution for the current trend to build well if you see your product must bring awareness to nouns so it doesn’t solve it and the trend is changing rapidly. To bring newbies it is good to build new tech<br/>
Simply user interface to solve your crypto needs is a existing need doubled up, You Get it.</p>
<p>Thanks<br/>
Keep on building innovately<br/>

<p>Hey man, thanks for your honest thoughts on the budget and the comparison to major platforms, I really enjoyed our convo, so I just got my first Noun and hope we can talk more and dive deeper with you fun people.</p>
<p>You’re absolutely right about the rapid change in trends and the necessity for innovation to attract newcomers. The goal we had wasn’t just to replicate what was already out there. Instead, it’s about creating a more intuitive, user-friendly interface that bridges the gap for newbies, making their entry into crypto smoother and less daunting - trust me, this didn’t change for years; what’s nice and easy for us is crazy scary for newbies, they don’t have any means to start with confidence.</p>
<p>I am really good at building product that combines new techs in different fields and creates outstanding user experiences. I will refine the proposal and update u. And yes ser, I’ll definitely keep your feedback in mind when I do it.</p>

<p>I am replying as an outsider of the Nouns community, an observer I should say. I think that what Nouns brings to the table is the decentralization of organizations, aka DAO, and this is where the focus should be, on the <strong>governance of Nouns itself</strong>, how decentralized/democratic it is, what mechanisms are in place for accountability, and of course to keep expanding and working on <strong>marketing elements</strong> as you’ve done well so far. So these are two vectors of action IMHO for the long term sustainability of the project. I kindly remind the community that as of 17/06/2023 out of the 290 projects approved, around 23,3% were yet to be implemented IRL. I don’t know what the figures would be by now. Just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>Music Festival Tickets - The First Nouns Music Festival</p>
<p>A ticketing platform powered by the Nouns Ecosystem. We are a group of festival organizers that aims to integrate our music event with blockchain technology. Making our already 10-year event as a marketing arm for the Nouns Ecosystem and blockchain technology in general. We need a sponsor who owns a Nouns NFT to support our vision and help us submit a proposal to the Nouns Ecosystem community.</p>
<p>I see Nouns project as a proposal platform which caters to the needs and interests of various individuals and organizations that are seeking innovative solutions and collaborations to support its ecosystem. Although I do not own a Nouns NFT, mainly because of its price, I like the idea of its unlimited supply yet only mints one every 24 hours to maintain rarity and exclusivity.</p>
<p>However, its limited accessibility for retail users due to its high prices on top of the already complex blockchain technology, retail users may find it difficult to participate in the Nouns project and in the blockchain space in general.</p>
<p>Our team aims to address this limitation by actively engaging with retail users and exploring ways to make blockchain technology valuable and accessible to a wider audience. This means that we will work on ways to give retail users a reason of value to incentivize their effort in learning and adopting blockchain technology.</p>
<p>One way we plan to implement is through the entertainment industry. A particular asset that we believe can bridge the gap between retail users and blockchain is through the tokenization of tickets for concerts, movies, and other live events. Current ticketing systems other than being inefficient and prone to fraud, also lack value after the event is over.</p>
<p>Hence, we envision creating a platform where event organizers can tokenize their tickets, inject an intrinsic value into them, and allow retail users to easily purchase, trade these tickets on the blockchain, and stake it for future rewards.</p>

<p>Hey Nouns<br/>
I am happy to be here.<br/>
I read through all the comments and ideas.<br/>
As a newbie here I wonder if this platform still works the way it was implemented for?</p>
<p>Where are all projects/prospects/ideas posted? How is it controlled? Or is the nouns-proposal ecosystem already a closed <img alt=":lock:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/lock.png?v=12" title=":lock:" width="20"/> system for only “the well known, famous high noun society”.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, if it is that way it would be a pity but easy to decide to take an idea to some VC or even to public authorities promoting start ups.</p>
<p>But I rather would love to go with nouns if it is what it always seemed to be on the first glance (at least for me)…:</p>
<p>A fantasic project of the bleeding edge of <em>Tech+Art+Social layer</em></p>
<p>Hope I wasn’t mistaken!</p>
