<p>Hey Nouners,</p>
<p>You may have seen me (Brandon James Scott / <span class="mention">@brandonmighty</span>) on twitter or around the discord.

<em>The Myth of Noun &amp; Nouns at Work collections</em></p>
<p>I am an artist with over fifteen years of experience in children’s entertainment via animation and publishing. I’m writing this proposal because I think the world needs a Nouns children’s book - and I’d like to make one.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#goals-1" name="goals-1"></a>Goals</h3>
<p>Introduce the fun, positive energy of Nouns to a young audience (and their parents). Create a wonderful nounish illustrated experience in physical form. Open a path to the traditional publishing world for Nouns.</p>

<em>tentative title/cover mockup</em></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#i-am-a-noun-2" name="i-am-a-noun-2"></a>I am a Noun</h3>
<p><em>I am a Noun</em> (tentative title) will be an illustrated book for young children where we meet, learn about, laugh with, laugh <em>at</em>, argue with, understand, admire and ultimately <em>love</em> the Nouns. It will read like a curious journey with occasional reader involvement instead of a traditional linear story. For those familiar with children’s books, think along the lines of Julie Morstad’s <em>Today,</em> Oliver Jeffer’s <em>Here We Are,</em> or Richard Scarry’s <em>Best Word Book Ever -</em> these books take a big idea and explore them visually and nonlinearly.</p>
<p>The book may start with asking a simple question to the reader: What <em>is</em> a noun? Our Nouns characters will have their opinions on this, which will lead to more questions, and more opinions - often at odds with each other and the narrator, with the reader stuck in the middle of it all. The book will be curious, funny, smart, absurd, and nounish… always. And it might end with another question for the reader: What kind of noun will <em>you</em> be?</p>
<p>You already have an idea of what it might look like. I don’t see the book as fully painted as my <em>Myth of Noun</em> pieces - probably more minimal like <em>Nouns at Work</em> with characters on simple backgrounds. And like the art I’ve done, I will base as much as possible on official Nouns traits. I’ll also be adding new characters (people, places, things…) and will put the Nouns glasses on almost everything.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the story will not directly reference the dao, nfts, crypto, ect. I would consider this project a very gentle trojan horse for nouns for a brand new audience.</p>
<p>I will also encourage and welcome any input from the Nounders as I develop this story to keep the nounish vibes in check. <strong>⌐◨-◨</strong></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#package-3" name="package-3"></a>Package</h3>
<p>This is not funding for a <em>finished</em> book, but rather funding for the development of a book submission package. Once a successful submission and sale takes place, the publisher would acquire publishing rights and offer an advance so that I may finish the rest of the book.</p>
<p>I have literary representation (Emily Van Beek at Folio Jr. literary agency) who has already shown interest and encouraged me to pursue this idea. I will work with her to fine tune this submission and once we’re both confident that it’s ready, she will work on my behalf to find a publisher for it.</p>
<p>I’d like funding from the DAO so I can devote time to write, illustrate and develop this idea into a package that would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A finished manuscript</li>
<li>A book ‘dummy’ (a sketched out layout of the full book)</li>
<li>2-3 pages of finished art</li>
<li>Cover art</li>
</ul>
<p>This amount of material makes up a strong package which solidifies all the main creative decisions (the concept, the story, the content and flow of the pages, and the final art style) for a confident submission.</p>
<p>The goal would be to have material ready to submit to publishers in fall 2022.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#funds-requested-4" name="funds-requested-4"></a>Funds Requested</h3>
<p>15 ETH</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#caveats-5" name="caveats-5"></a>Caveats</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is a small possibility that the normy publishing world may struggle to support a project based on a nft collection, or using a public domain ‘brand’, or because <em>we just</em> <em>don’t get it all those weird heads</em>. I don’t believe any of these things will happen because A) I believe I can create a wonderful, unique book that publishers will want, and B) I love the Nouns, and I believe many others will too.</li>
<li>I’ll be relying on my agent for her experience and advice with regard to submitting, and any and all publishers, from the big 5 to smaller indie publishers may be considered. In the event that a traditional publishing deal proves difficult, self-publishing could be another option, in which case I would return to the DAO to explore further funding for production and distribution with a separate proposal.</li>
<li>The DAO should anticipate that any book published with a traditional publisher will most likely end up in a more traditional copyright situation and not CC0.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR -</strong> I’m asking for 15 ETH to develop a robust submission package for a Nouns children’s book for traditional publishing.</p>

<p>1000% in on this, I would say that the Dao should fund the production and distribution of this book instead of waiting on a legacy publishing machine. I would love to see a series of “NOUNISH BOOKS” by different authors and artists. Perhaps the Dao can fund a creative incubator program to develop and proliferate nounish content. <span class="mention">@brandonmighty</span> this is an absolute win</p>

<p>Thanks Bigshot</p>
<p>I thought about going with a self publishing approach. While it would be much faster, I think the result would be a fun project that would circulate in the small community that exists and greatly limit more exposure to the larger world outside of web3.</p>
<p>While traditional publishing is slow, it can introduce Nouns to a far wider audience. Like I mentioned, a gentle trojan horse… I think projects like the one I propose can fit into the HelloKitty-fication idea of Nouns like I’ve seen <span class="mention">@4156</span> mention from time to time.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@brandonmighty</span> im IN LOVE with the idea of this book existing.</p>
<p>I have 1 question: If this is prop is funded and then it does struggle to get picked up by anyone, would we/you consider the next step being either self publishing funded by the DAO or something similar?</p>
<p>Would love to just see this happen and knowing there is a follow up plan we could push through if there is no support from the traditional world (when we’ve already spent 15 ETH -presumably on something great) then that would just be great to know!</p>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@goldy.mov</span>  - thanks!<br/>
Yes i actually mentioned down in the proposal that if the project struggled to find a trad publisher i would return here with a plan for self publishing and opening the project fully. My initial motivation/goal with this would be to spread the nouns far and wide, and a trad publishing deal would quite honestly have a much better shot at that than self publishing and trying to market/distribute oneself.<br/>
I do agree though - after funding the development of such an idea I would absolutely want it to happen and would follow up with the DAO to bring it to life if it can’t be done with a traditional publisher.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@brushee</span> - thanks!<br/>
See above for my comment to <span class="mention">@goldy.mov</span> too</p>
<p>If (when!) a publisher is found for this project, I’ll be pushing for CC0 as best I can. However, I just thought it was prudent to bring up in this proposal that from my view, the trad. publishing world may struggle with it. I’m sure this is something many builders working on nouns-related projects may struggle with if they’re building IP-related things outside of web3 due to the traditional view of copyright and IP.</p>
<p>I do think, in my view, that putting it into a more traditional copyright situation for the sake of getting a larger publishing deal and potentially much larger widespread brand awareness would be a good idea for the proliferation of nouns into the meatspace - though it’s of course up to the DAO if they agree with my view!</p>
