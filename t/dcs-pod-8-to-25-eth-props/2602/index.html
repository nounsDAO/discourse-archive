<p>The idea is to start a pod to fund the current marginalised props running in the 8 to 25 ETH range. This will be the DOING COOL SHIT POD.</p>
<p>The pod will convene once a week on an open call to discuss what has been proposed through discourse since the last meeting and be available to the community. This will foster discussion about props, help engage with builders and hopefully elevate the quality of props that get funded. (similar format to what we are doing with the esports pod)</p>
<p><strong>I am looking to find other 4 pod members</strong> to write a prop to run a multisig funding props at our discretion.</p>
<p>Budget: 148 ETH<br/>
Breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>props: 100 ETH</li>
<li>admin: 48 ETH
<ul>
<li>18 ETH for 1 person to be in charge of community engagement and regular meeting organization (3 ETH per month for 6 months)</li>
<li>30 ETH for pod members (1 ETH per person per month)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pod members are required to attend weekly meetings and actively give feedback on props. Pod members can be removed and replaced based on participation (which will be decided by the remaining members of the pod).</p>
<p>The person in charge of admin tasks will make a summary of the meeting in writing, which will be available to the public through discord (and possibly somewhere else, tbd), be active on discourse and discord (granted a channel is created in the nouns server. otherwise we’d have our own discord).</p>
<p>The committee’s gnosis safe will require 3 of 5 members to sign.</p>

<p>UPDATED PROP</p>
<h1>
<a class="anchor" href="#dcs-pod-1" name="dcs-pod-1"></a>DCS pod</h1>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong><br/>
A pod that funds props ranging from 8-25 Ξ.</p>
<p>The idea is to start a pod to fund the current marginalised props running in the 8 to 25 ETH range. This will be the DOING COOL SHIT POD.</p>
<p><strong>The pod plays a role in three ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>By funding asks in the 8-25 Ξ range, it helps builders scope work that are larger than NSFW’s and Prop House’s provisions, and lower than regular on-chain asks.</li>
<li>It has a transparent decision making framework. (but the decisions are discretionary and will not be put up to a DAO vote)</li>
<li>It gives voice to often overlooked, but high potential proposals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will the group work?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Props will be submitted to the pod through forms.</li>
<li>Prop will be discussed on call.</li>
<li>Prop will be voted on discord.</li>
</ol>
<p>An <a href="https://www.addressform.io/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AddressBoard</a> platform will be first created to receive proposal ideas, just like what has been created for <a href="https://www.addressform.io/board/f4772eb9-9ee3-479b-b957-d602415a100b" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Lil Sisters Fund</a> (see image below).</p>

Lil Sisters AddressBoard application form.</p>
<p>The pod will convene once a week on an open call to discuss what has been proposed through AddressBoard since the last meeting and be available to the community. This will foster discussion about props, help engage with builders and hopefully elevate the quality of props that get funded. (similar format to what I, B, am doing with Lil Sisters and the esports pod)</p>
<p>After discussion, pod members will decide which props will be funded by voting on a dedicated discord channel.</p>
<p>Pod members are required to attend weekly meetings and actively give feedback on props. Pod members can be removed and replaced based on participation (which will be decided by the remaining members of the pod).</p>
<p>The person in charge of admin tasks will make a summary of the meeting in writing, which will be available to the public through on the DCS discord, be active on discourse and discord (a discord server will be created on the approval of this prop).</p>
<p>To help engage with the community, we will create a twitter account where each prop can be tweeted about and receive feedback from the community as replies.</p>
<p>The committee’s gnosis safe will require 3 of 5 members to sign.</p>
<p>Budget: 468 ETH<br/>
Breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>props: 300 ETH</li>
<li>admin: 168 ETH
<ul>
<li>18 ETH for 1 person to be in charge of community engagement and regular meeting organization (3 ETH per month for 6 months)</li>
<li>150 ETH for pod members (5 ETH per person per month)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For context, this is 1,6% of our treasury. We are aiming to propose a low-risk/high-reward pod.</p>

<p>If at the end of the 6-month period not enough good props were found and funded, the funds will be returned to the Nouns DAO treasury. If the props funded were to be successful, leading to cool apps/tools/community building/engagement, we would ask for the continuation of the work through extended funding (granted by a new on-chain prop).</p>

<p>I really like the emphasis on an orderly schedule, public feedback and pod accountability. As with all pods, I think it’s important to demonstrate a real use-case and track-record before an ask of this size. A 75 ETH pool (any combo between 9x 8ETH projects - 3x 25 ETH projects) and a 3 month term should be enough to get up and running and show what DCS Pod can do.</p>

I’ve discussed with the pod and we all agree with your suggestions. So it would be:<br/>

<li>props: 75 ETH</li>
<li>admin: 51 ETH

<li>6 ETH for 1 person to be in charge of community engagement and regular meeting organization (2 ETH per month for 3 months)</li>

<p>I like the structure you’ve laid out and love to see more grants programs being born. Also, I agree and prefer the new budget size (126 ETH). Feels more reasonable given its a first go.</p>
<p>Since the ecosystem is now taking new shape with the dissolution of a central discord, have you given thought to how you are going to attract new builders? What sort of builders DCS is best suited to fund?</p>
<p>While grants pods by size certainly worked prior to discord dissolution, I think it’s worth considering grant pods by distribution or expertise or even a mix of the two (eg nouns brazil, nouns music, etc). The goal being to have the people closest to the builders, who have the most context and are best suited to the make domain-specific decisions, be the ones funding them as opposed to having a DAO-wide grant bucket for specific ranges.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that pods shouldn’t have parameters to abide by (I don’t have a problem with DCS doing 8 - 25 ETH) or that open-ended grant pods don’t make sense but maybe it’s worth explaining what DCS would be looking to fund and why they are well suited to do so?</p>
<p>If the futures paints the DAO as having several grant programs ongoing, I think they should be funded on the merits of why they are best suited to serve some specific subset of builders (eg distribution, expertise, etc).</p>

<p>I agree that having people closer to the builders is great. But I also know that it will be difficult to see Nouns DAO allocating larger sums to all sub-daos/pods we have so we all could fund these larger props.</p>
<p>Also, it still leaves the problem of 8-25 ETH props unresolved, if they do not fit into a category we already tap into. If something new, aimed at a new audience comes in, they would still be facing the issue. And I have had against votes simply because of my ask (~13 eth), so we could miss out on cool props bc they are in this range.</p>
<p>So in the end we will still have the issue of marginalised props, if they are in a new area and would not be funded by one of the current pods/sub-daos.</p>
<p>I’d be super happy to reach out to an expert in their field depending on what prop comes to us. I’ve been in contact with people from different spheres, which is awesome, and would give me the ability to tap into those contacts and resources. This would be a way to have an expert opinion, and fix the marginalised prop issue. Also, contacting the field experts so they know of DCS pod is a first step for them to send builders our way, getting people aware and tweeting/sharing on discord, p.e., so more builders find out about us.</p>
<p>I know I am not proposing anything different than what’s above, but trying to fund all areas we cover is going to be a huge task. The DCS pod could also give us a sense of where these props are coming from, so, if we decide to go your route (which would be great), we know where to allocate more funds/fund first.</p>

<p>I think this sort of funding mechanism is needed, that being said, paying admins 0.68 for every 1 eth spend on funding doesnt sit right with me.<br/>
I dont think there will even be enough workload to justify paying 6 people 3 eth a month, what are these numbers based on?<br/>
AFAIK only a tiny amount of proposals fit within this range and cant be cut down to a sub 8 eth MVP.</p>

<p>The workload is yet to be determined, but as we know it can be a lot of work. Another reason why we shortened the trial: if there is less work than expected, we reduce the compensation, p.e.<br/>
And I see what you mean with the percentage of compensation and prop funding, but I also do not believe people should work for free (although I also do work for free on other pods). We are currently paying 20k-30k USD per month for people working for the DAO, and this is significantly lower.<br/>
It is also important to keep in mind we will read, analise and discuss a lot of props to get to the ones that get funding, so our end work will not just be limited to the number of props that are funded, but will/could be a lot higher.<br/>
I will gladly increase the budget for props to shift that ratio =)</p>
