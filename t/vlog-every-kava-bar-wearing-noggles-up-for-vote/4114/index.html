<p>This proposal is already active and up-for-vote in Nouns Prop House. Just want to show that I’m here, and I’m not scared to talk openly and loudly about what I believe in.</p>
<p>I have a prop that would allow me to visit every kava bar in Miami running in Nouns Open Round 16.</p>
<p>I have a prop that would help me visit every kava bar in St. Petersburg [Florida] running in Noggles DAO, under their first funding round “Noggles IRL.”</p>
<p>There is AMPLE information on my Twitter page about the prop, and I will share/link some of that here.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/txlogs/status/1635117073608343554" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">This link</a> goes to a thread I wrote about the drinks sold at kava bars, and why I believe these bars are going to continue growing in popularity.</p>
<p>I see a world where ~ when someone goes to YT to search information about kava, which will be consistently on the rise for 5-10 years ~ they simultaneously learn about Nouns.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/txlogs/status/1635371531533713408" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">This link</a> will take you to a thread where I deep-dive into my YouTube analytics.</p>
<p>My channel is small rn with 537 subscribers, but analytics don’t lie ~ with consistency my channel will grow, and the props I have up for vote will allow me to make 4-6 weeks worth of content, published every Friday. This is a massive runway for me, and would help bridge the gap to getting kava bar sponsorships, as well as monetary support from my viewers.</p>
<p>In summary: People like seeing me in the Noggles! I get an absurd amount of comments on them, and am consistently having to tell people “I didn’t invent these. But if you go to <a href="http://Nouns.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns.wtf</a> you can see what all hype is about.”</p>
<p>Hoping to get as much support on these proposals as possible, so if you have questions or comments I encourage you to reach out! I am accessible and well versed on the subjects of both Kava Bars and Nouns.</p>
<p>Grill me, I can take the heat.</p>
<p>x. Spark Twain<br/>
