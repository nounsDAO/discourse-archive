<p><em><strong>TL;DR - Are we comfortable with Finder’s Fees for people bringing in high quality proposals?</strong></em></p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#context-1" name="context-1"></a>CONTEXT</h2>
<p>Soon, an Explorer Grants recipient will go on-chain with a proposal. This is incredibly exciting and exactly what we built Explorer Grants for - to bring more valuable proposals by builders to the DAO.</p>
<p>Before it goes on-chain and we discuss the logistics of that proposal, I want to discuss a more philosophical point around Nouns and Explorer Grants, and separate that conversation from the prop itself, so as not to overshadow it.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#what-are-finders-fees-2" name="what-are-finders-fees-2"></a>WHAT ARE FINDER’S FEES?</h2>
<p>Finder’s Fees seem to be a bit polarizing in Nouns and crypto, but they are a widely popular in various industries because <strong>they align incentives - people only get paid when they deliver the value</strong>. Recruiters get paid a percentage of a recruit’s salary, marketers get paid when they bring in leads or sales, and finance people get paid a percent of what their works bring to the firm. In our case, people would get paid for bringing and passing a high quality proposal.</p>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#fees-in-nouns-3" name="fees-in-nouns-3"></a>FEES IN NOUNS</h2>
<p><strong>There is a precedent for Finder’s Fees within Nouns</strong> - the DAO (almost) unanimously passed a prop with a 7% reward in July of last year <a href="https://nouns.wtf/vote/113">Prop 113</a> - paying someone ~7 ETH for bringing the proposal to the DAO. <em><strong>113 lead to the “This is Nouns” video which was clearly a net positive for the DAO and lead to our first <a href="https://nouns.wtf/vote/190">Droposal</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p><em>The downstream effect of one person’s effort to bring in a proposal was incredibly positive, and likely worth more than the fee.</em></p>
<p>In the case of Explorer Grants, people might say - aren’t you already getting paid a salary from your prop? Yes, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partially performance-based pay is standard in many industries</li>
<li>Our salary for our pilot was much lower than most Nounish teams, and knowing that the DAO is supportive of Finder’s Fees would help us keep that up-front salary low</li>
<li>Finder’s Fees will help us reinvest in our project and the ecosystem, not just pay ourselves</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>I think the potential for Finder’s Fees is huge across the DAO</strong></em>, not just for Explorer Grants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher focus on performance for pods like Explorer Grants, DCS, NSFW, etc…</li>
<li>Financial incentive for Nouners to Nouns-pill their friends and have them contribute to the DAO</li>
<li>New roles can emerge because there is precedent for rewards: bringing in big brands, recruiting artists, creating DAO partnerships</li>
<li>One could see a world where <a href="https://twitter.com/anquetil/status/1603559776692056064" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">front-ends even take a smaller fee</a> for bringing in new sales or proposals, reducing the cost of their up-front proposals</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Performance-based pay would allow Nouns DAO to save money by paying mostly when value is delivered, not when it is promised.</em></p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#follow-ups-4" name="follow-ups-4"></a>Follow-Ups</h2>
<p>Counterpoints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this align incentives? Wouldn’t this just incentivize someone to ask for more money so they get a bigger fee?
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the DAO passes a big proposal, is that wrong? Isn’t that what the DAO wants?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>We could go the route of flat rewards - 5 ETH no matter what. (Although if someone could get Nike to put Nouns on a jersey - that would surely be worth more than 5 ETH?)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Won’t this just accelerate treasury spending?
<ul>
<li>Maybe, but if the treasury is going to valuable proposals - isn’t that the whole point?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wouldn’t the Explorer Grants participants have contributed to Nouns anyways?
<ul>
<li>I don’t think so - they would have if they could.</li>
<li>You could make the same case of any affiliate marketing program or recruiting service!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we want to establish this as a social norm, we should find a friendlier term than “Finder’s Fee”</li>
<li>What should the percentage of the reward be? 5% of total ask?</li>
</ul>
