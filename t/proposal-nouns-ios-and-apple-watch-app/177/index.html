<p>Adding the text from the doc below. To see images you’ll need to check out the Google doc. Discourse limits the number of images you can embed in a post.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, suggestions, and concerns.</p>

<p>Nouns Collective proposal <span class="hashtag">#1</span></p>
<p><strong>Nouns iOS and Apple Watch app</strong></p>
<p>[draft - please share your feedback]</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>In the interest of building momentum around Nouns as a cultural phenomenon and helping to reach a wider audience, we propose building a fun and quirky iOS app and companion Apple Watch app. These applications will create a playful Noun o’clock experience, allow Noun enthusiasts to explore all of the created Nouns, as well as play around with creating their own off-chain Nouns in fun and creative ways (among other features, examples below).</p>
<p><strong>Apple Watch Application:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nouns watch face
<ul>
<li>Fun and goofy way to keep track of time (working within the constraints of Apple watch and WatchOS 8)</li>
<li>Background photo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom Watch complication for Noun o’clock</li>
<li>Notification about Noun o’clock</li>
<li>Watch app can display:
<ul>
<li>Noun avatar as watch face</li>
<li>Noun o’clock countdown</li>
<li>Generate your own (off-chain Noun)</li>
<li>Share Nouns (iMessage, or share sheet)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>iOS App</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Notifications about Noun o’clock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make your own Noun (off-chain)</p>
<ul>
<li>Use it as your watch face</li>
<li>Save it and use it as an avatar</li>
<li>Share it with others (way to enable virality/spread of Nouns)</li>
<li>There’s an opportunity to make this very playful and tactile by letting users shake their phone to generate a random Noun or swipe to edit characteristics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nouns explorer</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse a record/catalogue of all of the onchain Nouns that have been minted and sold thus far, with additional meta-data</li>
<li>Browse a saved record of personal “saved” off-chain Nouns created by the user (using the app)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future extensions</p>
<ul>
<li>Nouns iOS widget for your homescreen</li>
<li>iMessage sticker pack</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Considerations + Source code</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>App will be built in Swift and backend in Node + Typescript
<ul>
<li>Open question: are there any existing internal Nouns APIs we can leverage for some of the data similar to the Nouns explorer project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Target operating systems will be iOS 15 and WatchOS 8 which is set to release later this month</li>
<li>All code will be open sourced. Our goal is to encourage others in the community to extend the apps and leverage the assets for the Android Nouns app.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>The overall design aesthetic for this product is meant to be consistent with the overall visual design of the nouns.wtf website, the Nouns themselves, and just generally be contemporary, modern, and fun.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share figma file and screen shots, enable comments from the community</li>
<li>Describe interactions and other functional aspect of the design like flows in the figma file as well for inspection and commentary</li>
<li>In the spirit of open source, we will involve the Nouns community to participate and influence the app development in a number of key ways:
<ul>
<li>Open sourcing the code via github for inspection by the community</li>
<li>Providing updates on the design and development regularly via discord</li>
<li>Allowing actual Nounders and members of Nouns DAO to participate in feedback sessions and select user/usability testing sessions to improve build quality.</li>
<li>Open up a public beta of the app for the Nouns community (Noun holders and non-holders) to participate in via test flight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Concept, design, and development are scoped to 4 months. See schedule below:</p>

<p><strong>Co-creation and beta testing</strong></p>
<p>We love to build in public and plan to work in close collaboration with the Nouns community, through co-creation workshops and consistent feedback loops via Discord. We will be running a beta test of both the iOS and Watch applications to identify bugs early and other deficiencies, in the aim of increasing build quality and level of polish before launch.</p>

<p>This is really exciting.  Dev team looks very impressive and would be great to have in the ecosystem, and this type of project is perfectly in line with the type of thing I think will increase public awareness of Nouns, and something I would personally use.</p>

<p>Nothing but love for this proposal! While I know most of the early community will love this, it also feels like a great opportunity for non crypto natives to explore Nouns.</p>
<p>Big +1 from me. Thank you to the team for considering building on Nouns. We’re lucky to have you in the ecosystem!</p>

<p>Can you address the likelihood that the app will pass Apple’s App Review? My understanding is that other apps that were used to display NFTs have been blocked.</p><aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric" data-onebox-src="https://cryptobriefing.com/apple-apps-hosting-nfts-not-appropriate-for-app-store/">

<p>Given the caliber of the team and that all builders are doxxed, I think it would be fine to go with a 100% up-front payment. If the community feels otherwise, I’d say a simpler structure: 50/50 up-front and on completion. This would prevent delays caused by the current proposal process.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing this! It looks like Apple is taking a stance against storing and sending NFTs.That’s my read on this. I think we should be fine since we’ll be focused on exploring and viewing. We’ll also have off-chain Nouns (playground), this should make it clear to Apple what the intention and focus of the app are - it’s more of a companion app with the aim of making a fun experience around Nouns. I don’t think we even need to mention “NFTs” in the app description. From a risk mitigation perspective, we have some contacts at Apple and can use that relationship to try and get some clarity around the guidelines. And we also have the option of scoping out any problematic features, if it comes to that.</p>

<p>What an exciting proposal! Love it.</p>
<p>However,  I’m concerned about having an expenditure that uses such a high percentage of our treasury at this point. I’d be very supportive if we had projects up and running that were generating income, and we will. It feels premature to spend our $ on fun stuff, (albeit fantastic PR), statues, and charity BEFORE we are successful at monetizing our position.</p>
<p>I advise patience. Let’s put our focus on strengthening the Dao in a sustainable way, then do the fun cool stuff when we’re on terra firma. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>

<p>Idea: if you own the noun you have on your Apple Watch, what if you added a blue verification checkmark (or a symbol to indicate you own it that’s aesthetically pleasing)? Would be a cool way to “flex” lol</p>
