<p>Hello Nouns community!</p>
<p>I am reaching out as the co-founder of the <a href="https://w3up.cc/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">W3UP Project</a> with an exciting partnership opportunity that we believe would greatly benefit your DAO and its members.</p>
<p>Considering your active and engaged community, we feel that you are the perfect partner for this venture. We would like to offer you the chance to have your very own custom Top-Level Domain (TLD) for your blockchain project, similar to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and their “.eth” TLD.</p>
<p>Imagine having a TLD like “.nouns” or even something more unique and eye-catching like “.⌐◨-◨”! This would not only strengthen your brand identity but also provide an additional revenue stream for the DAO, as we propose a 50-50 split of the minting fee.</p>
<p>To make this collaboration a reality, our team at W3UP will take care of the technical aspects, including the creation and implementation of the custom TLD. All we need is your support and enthusiasm to bring this project to life!</p>
<p>We’ve prepared a demonstration using the Uniswap brand (for non-commercial purposes) to showcase our platform’s capabilities. You can visit <a href="https://uni.w3up.cc/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://uni.w3up.cc/</a> to mint your own “.uni” domain and test our platform. This example was specifically chosen to celebrate Uniswap’s arrival on the Binance Smart Chain.</p>
<p>For more information on this partnership, please review our documentation here: W3Up DAO-NFT Partnership</p>
<p>We are excited about the potential of this partnership and would love to discuss it further with your community. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us. We’re looking forward to hearing your thoughts and exploring this opportunity together!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Kob<br/>

<p><a href="https://nns.xyz/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://nns.xyz/</a> currently offers registration for the <strong>.⌐◨-◨</strong> TLD, and <strong>.nouns</strong> handshake domains are available to register on a few major registrars.</p>
<p>Can you please elaborate on how what you’re offering adds to what is already available?</p>
