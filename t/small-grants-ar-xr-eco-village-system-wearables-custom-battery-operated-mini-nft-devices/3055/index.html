    Hello! 
G.t. Press here! (<span class="mention">@GuerrillaThink</span> on twitter) not a noun-holder. 
BACKGROUND &amp; CONTEXT: 
In late 2020, early 2021, the City of Olympia, WA, USA partnered with a small start-up natural building company called Earth Homes LLC to coordinate volunteers to help build “microhouses” for the homeless. You can watch this 2.5 minute video about it:

    [Micro Housing Project Olympia 2021]
  </a>


Then yours truly and a few others decided it would be cool if we got a microhouse donated to our star…
  </blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Quoted from post: "What if use of this “micro-noun-bed-n-breakfast” were governed by NFTs and smart contracts? Or at the very least had on-chain 100% transparency with built-in automated funding of homelessness focused non-profits and projects via endaoment or other systems?</p>
<p>We’d like to explore the tangible realities of how to experiment with the technologies to make them a useful and functional way to book a room on a private property. Whatever we accomplish with the tech, would be open-sourced to the community. Our most radical idea is to make the function of booking a room fund a particular wallet which then can be given to a sponsored homeless person who needs a hand up.</p>
<p>We decided that the muralized microhouse would fit into the aesthetic of the property (which includes several other art installations and amazing permaculture projects!). We also thought that an Alternate Reality Game Scavenger Hunt* with nouns hidden throughout the property would be a fantastic expansion project.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Dreamseed aims to host private events hosted by artists for DAOs, start-ups and other communities in a beautiful forested eco-village retreat center. Currently in renovations, Dreamseed is raising funds through small projects to finish ongoing projects and begin welcoming guests and visiting artists."</p>
