<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Project:</strong></em> Nouns Wallet is a nouns-branded and nouns-themed (described in the “Description” section below in the proposal) web extension wallet with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1EWVLH7EglDcLLMEpWV-4mmttxp96wpEe2b4v7jD-2QE/edit" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">latest untrusted (t, N) threshold MPC cryptography</a> that can be utilised for empowering active crypto users and pushing the crypto ethos forward by making security accessible to all in a Nounstandingly simple and fun way.</p>
<p>The threshold MPC algorithm is developed in-house and has various advantages over other implementations of threshold MPC (explained in the “How is our threshold MPC different from others’?” section below in the proposal).</p>
<p><em><strong>Funding ask:</strong></em> total of 500 ETH over 3 rounds (inclusive of 200 ETH for code audit)</p>
<p><em><strong>Estimated Revenue from project to Nouns treasury:</strong></em> Conservative estimate between $3M to $5M a year until the wallets industry undergoes the next major revolution (plus increased recognition for Nouns). Basis for this estimation is explained in the “Estimated revenue to the Nouns treasury from this project” section below in the proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>With our credible cryptography skills, we have an innovative collaborative proposal to offer — a nouns-branded web extension wallet system with threshold MPC options incorporated into it. The wallet will use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1EWVLH7EglDcLLMEpWV-4mmttxp96wpEe2b4v7jD-2QE/edit" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">our in-house untrusted (t, N) threshold cryptography</a>, the latest threshold cryptography, to construct a system that simultaneously solves security and liquidity problems for active crypto users and pushes the crypto ethos forward by catering to the need for such a type of service. The web extension wallet will be focused towards optional threshold security, an intuitive UI/UX and creative Noun branding ideas, suggestions to which we are open to (eg. having a unique Noun wallet logo for every wallet, a tab showcasing the bid for the current noun, and/or other creative suggestions). A very basic design mock-up has been created just to show the threshold signing process (we are open to completely changing the UI/UX as per suggestions of the community and our own improvisations but this part is for Round 3):</p>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Hot wallets generally have low security unless linked to an external hardware wallet (eg. Ledgers). Having an untrusted (t, N) threshold MPC wallet system where signatures are split among different devices, will reduce the risk of single point of compromised keys. Multiple wallets will need to sign a transaction, in order to make signatures valid. The entire key will NEVER exist in its complete form - neither during generation nor during signing.</p>
<p><strong>How is our threshold MPC different from others’?</strong></p>
<p>The following feature summary compares our approach with the traditional and the other modern approaches. The smiley emoji indicates a point where we have an advantage over both the traditional as well as the other modern approaches.</p>

<li>BLS</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round 2 - 150 ETH</p>

<p><strong>Estimated Revenue to the Nouns treasury from this project</strong></p>
<p>MetaMask average daily revenue over the last 2 months from fees looks like around $200,000 a day (translating to $70M a year approx) from eyeballing <a href="https://dune.com/queries/19721/40444" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this chart</a>. More details on daily and cumulative swap fee revenue for MetaMask is on <a href="https://dune.com/tomhschmidt/metamask-swap" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this dashboard</a> and <a href="https://thedefiant.io/metamask-raking-in-170k-day-shows-defi-wallets-work-as-businesses" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this article</a>.</p>
<p>Exodus quarterly revenues for the last 2 year’s Q3s have been $18M and $11M respectively, details on <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/09/2552383/0/en/Exodus-Report-Third-Quarter-2022-Results.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this page</a>.</p>
<p>We aim to compete with MetaMask and other hot wallets by offering the latest threshold MPC system built into a web extension hot wallet.</p>
<p>Going by the numbers above, we conservatively estimate that this project could eventually start generating $3M - $5M per year as swap fees. It could go as high as $70M like MetaMask.</p>
<p>A major portion of that revenue would keep going to the Nouns DAO treasury and a small portion to the devs team for maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosures &amp; background of contributors</strong></p>
<p>The contributors of this project are creators of a subdivision (the R&amp;D department) of the cryptocurrency exchange ZebPay. We are spinning out of ZebPay as the “Insaanity” group, and hence looking for independent funding.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago we began the crypto R&amp;D journey with few principles and beliefs that brought us together. Insanity’s first goal is to reform the financial infrastructure of the world through crypto. Building this threshold scheme is just one of the many contributions we plan to bring to the crypto space in order to help spread the crypto ethos.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@maxand98</span> the code is open source enough to prove that we can do MPC, not enough to be usable. That way we can protect our core algorithm which has many advantages compared to other threshold MPC implementations in the market (as described in the proposal above). Key generation, pre-signing and signature are open sourced for EdDSA (which is Cardano, XRP and Polkadot).

<p>I like it and can see a lot of usability in the future, however I think the creative Ideas you mentioned are very important and should be more fledged before putting the proposal on-chain.<br/>
I also think you should take marketing into account, it will not be easy to bring people into a brand new wallet unless they have very clear and worthwhile (non-technical) benefits for doing so.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@blueguy</span> thank you for the feedback very useful. Taking the crucial points you mentioned into consideration, we are working towards more specific and creative UI UX design ideas and wallet features that would attract the non-technical audience and build brand identity. Will upload them here before going on-chain. Will also outline a plan for marketing the wallet later… Glad to see that you recognise the usability of this product!</p>

<p>Wow. What an awesome concept. I like the idea of having a Nouns wallet. It feels like a similar bet to Nouns Builder where we can fund the building blocks of an entire ecosystem and then as Nouns gradually beats out the 10k PFP projects, all of the tools will gather momentum together.</p>
<p>As far as the proposal, I really think a working demo of some kind should be available for something like this. If Nouns ultimately doesn’t want to do this, it would be really interesting to approach someone like Zora to see if they would be interested in helping to make it come to life and doing some kind of revenue split with you, Zora and Nouns and the devs. Might even be a good prop for Nouns Builder.</p>
<p>The other funding source to try might be something like DCS pod if you can make your proof of concept fit into the 25ETH range. They are looking for scalable, high impact ideas.</p>
<p>Anyway, good luck! I hope to see it happen. Would love to have you come and speak about this in Nouncil sometime as well to get some more traction and feedback. Pop in if you are interested!</p>

<p>The concept is really cool. It is important that its implementation is also at a high level. We have seen many wallet options that are forgotten after a month. I think that with the help of a strong community, wallet support should not raise questions. Although this story should be considered in the long term, and not just be a trend event that will be forgotten like many others.</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="mention">@BETEPAH</span> for you feedback! Yes that’s correct, the implementation must also be at a high level. We as a to-be independently funded R&amp;D group, are not only passionate about making projects like these successful but also fully incentivised to do so. The success of Nouns Wallet would buy us a lot of credibility as a group. With the Nouns DAO funding and participation we hope to create an impressive front end and a marketing plan to highlight in a simple and clear manner the unique technical selling points that our product offers to users and incorporate non-technical benefits in our wallet as well.</p>
