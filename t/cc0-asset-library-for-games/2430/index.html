<p>I’ve been looking for a Cryptoadz sprite sheet to use in a game I am building which uses CC0 NFT assets (Heroes <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-heroes-nft-collection" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://opensea.io/collection/the-heroes-nft-collection</a>).</p>
<p>Doesnt seem like anyone has made them? Had the thought that a CC0 game asset library would be valuable. What do people think about this? Most of the work would be creating the sprites. I have been working with an artist on Hero sprites could potentially make toad/noun sprites. Maybe someone else from the community could help too.</p>
<p>I could make the website. If i could get a dedicated artist or two what do people think about this as a formal proposal?</p>

<p>I’m very supportive of CC0 Nouns spritesheets for game designers. Would be a great resource to put into the world. A step further:</p>
<ul>
<li>CC0 pixel environments</li>
<li>host a game jam for devs to use these assets</li>
</ul>

<p>To create a large open-source asset library sounds like a great proposal idea. There are a ton of artists in the community, so I’m sure if you get active in the discord and look for some like-minded people, you could form a team in no time. If I can help writing the prop or you just want some feedback on ideas, please don’t be afraid to reach out!</p>
