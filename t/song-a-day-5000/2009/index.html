<p>Hey all! Your friendly neighborhood song a day Mann here.</p>
<p>My 5000th song is coming up, and I was wondering if there’s any appetite for Nouns bidding on the NFT. I feel like I’ve seen most proposals around collecting NFTs get voted down, which makes sense; Nouns is not a collecting DAO! However, I feel like there could be some resonance here with Song A Day specifically.</p>
<p>We’re both focused around making 1 thing a day. The structure of my DAO (<a href="https://songaday.world/songadao/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SongADAO</a>) was directly inspired by Nouns. And I did make the song for <a href="https://nouns.wtf/vote/10">Noun 69</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I have been chatting with some folks about the possibility of making a Nouns Rock Opera! (But that’s a story for another post.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m throwing this idea out there to see what happens. I keep thinking about Beeple’s 5000th going for 23,000 eth and thinking, “How can I make sure SAD <span class="hashtag">#5000</span> goes for a similar amount!” <img alt=":star_struck:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/star_struck.png?v=12" title=":star_struck:" width="20"/></p>

<p>I went and listened to a couple songs. Very cool idea. I think you’d have a lot of trouble getting a vote from the DAO because it’s not Nounish per se, but I’m still glad you posted it. There are a lot of music lovers in the community and I hope you attract some more people to your DAO through it.</p>
<p>Also wanted to mention that I heard some chatter on Twitter about a similar idea for a music DAO collective auctioning Nouns with songs attached as a derivative project. Maybe you’d be interested in searching that out and joining their venture as an artist partner? Just figured I’d mention it.</p>

<p>Love your stuff!  Fan of your work for sure but not sure how it fits into the Nounish ecosystem. Maybe there’s a specific collab that can be done in the future that feels more organic for both parties?</p>
<p>Congrats on this milestone!</p>
