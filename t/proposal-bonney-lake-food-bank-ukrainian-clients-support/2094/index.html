<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been following Nouns DAO for some time now and am very interested in how you support charities from time to time.  We are a food bank in WA State (USA) and would like to request a donation from Nouns DAO to help support, specifically, the growing number of Ukrainian customers we see coming through our doors.</p>
<p>I am not a Nouns holder so I would need support from members of this community to sponsor my application if it is something of interest to you.  I have linked below a google doc that explains our request and would welcome any questions or comments on it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time and consideration,</p>
