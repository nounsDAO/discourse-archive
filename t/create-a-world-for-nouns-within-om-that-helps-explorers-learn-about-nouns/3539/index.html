<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br/>
I’m interested in expanding the world I built within within OM. I think that it can act as a touchpoint for explorers of the OM metaverse to dive into the nouns ecosystem. I’d like to request 3-5 eth for this project. I am a Lil Nouns builder and I’m interested in building a fun way to explore and learn about the nouns ecosystem. I would be submitting this proposal using Lil Nouns pipeline which means that I need to have LilNounsDAO approve the proposal before I can bring it on chain to Nouns but it is, of course, important to seek out feedback from NounsDAO about the idea. So I thought I would share the idea here, and understand first if this is something that NounsDAO would be interested in. Appreciate any feedback, ty.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong><br/>
I started this project as a prop house proposal and built it specifically for lilnounsdao. I want to expand on my initial build by making it an engaging touchpoint where users can learn about the noun ecosystem in a fun way.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br/>
Expand and refine the current build.</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong><br/>
As users move throughout the 3D world, they will be able to visually understand the noun ecosystem. Moving from one area of the world to another will put them in a setting that is either specific to nounsdao or noun subdao ecosystems. Positioned throughout the world will be signs that describe aspects of the noun ecosystem and experiences within it.</p>
<p><strong>Additions to the Om Space:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sculptures of nouns/lil nouns/food nouns/gnars nouns/public nouns/lost nouns characters throughout the world.</li>
<li>I plan to improve texture mapping and baking materials to improve how lighting falls on surfaces.</li>
<li>Expand on the current build by adding in more noun assets to make the world larger and a better place to explore.</li>
<li>Create a visual narrative where users can actively explore and learn about the Nouns Ecosystem in the metaverse (within Om)</li>
</ul>
