<p>Hi, I saw this and remembered about an old NFT project I was part of a few years ago, they looked the same and we were able to stake our NFTs. The project also had bought a lot of NFTs like board ape and stuff for the dao. Is this that project? If so what happened to the NFTs I owned that has been for staking for ever since, I forgot about it. I donâ€™t even remember the webpage where I did the staking. Can someone help me plz, the NFTs looked just like these, I had an ape and some other stuff.</p>
