<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#tldr-2" name="tldr-2"></a>TL;DR:</h2>
<p>We’re proposing to build a mobile platformer game with 700 levels in which we introduce players to nounish concepts and educate them on Nouns DAO and adjacent extensions while playing through fun and engaging maps. We’re seeking $200,000 USD which covers a professional production team and development over 9 months for 700 playable levels plus a marketing campaign.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#description-3" name="description-3"></a>Description</h2>
<p>We want to teach players about Nouns DAO in a simple and entertaining way by introducing them to each noun and their journey to being minted plus introducing them to the people, places and things in the nouniverse, such as the noggles.</p>

<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#the-game-is-divided-into-two-parts-4" name="the-game-is-divided-into-two-parts-4"></a>The game is divided into two parts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Single Player</li>
<li>Multiplayer</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#single-player-5" name="single-player-5"></a>Single Player</h3>
<p>The single-player mode is a platformer game.</p>
<p>In this mode the player controls their noun to reach it’s destination - to be minted and sent to auction at <strong>Nouns DAO</strong>.</p>
<p>There is a unique level for each noun minted, designed with various obstacles and challenges.</p>
<p>We as a nounish family are waiting every day to see what the next noun will look like and how much the winning bid is at the auction for the previous noun, but we don’t know anything about each noun’s background story. We don’t know what a noun has been through before it gets minted! This concept was the inspiration for this game.</p>
<h4>
<a class="anchor" href="#gameplay-6" name="gameplay-6"></a>Gameplay</h4>
<p>The player controls their noun throughout each level in a 3D playground. Nouns can run, jump, grab, climb, dive + more to overcome the obstacles until the final point is reached and the noun goes through the gate to get minted.</p>
<p>There is ether on the path that the player must collect to meet the goal. The goal amount of ether is set based on how much that noun sold for at auction.</p>
<p>After completing each level, the player is awarded three stars. The first star is just for completing the level and the second one is awarded if the count of collected ether has reached the winning bid amount and the last star is awarded based on the time spent completing the level.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="animated" data-base62-sha1="lyf4b5Qr4c4XoK9ur7ZlO5VYaNf" height="251" role="presentation" src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/original/2X/9/970c967df4ad2a90e2f8c7a1d6f202bd1e9e8025.gif" width="600"/></p>
<p>For example: The first level is about Noun 1 being minted and the player will have to guide the noun through the course while collecting enough ether to meet the winning bid on that noun, all the while trying to do it in the fastest time possible.</p>

<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#multiplayer-7" name="multiplayer-7"></a>Multiplayer</h3>
<p>In this mode of the game, players enter a battle royal like Fall Guys and compete with one another.</p>
<p>Each session starts with 40 players and three matches are held in each session. At the end of each match only half of the players wake it through, then at the end of the third match, the final player wins the match.</p>
<p>The game and environment design is nounish and each level/match has its own unique theme based on nounish extensions such as lil nouns, Gnars DAO, Alps DAO and many others where spectators are members of these communities.</p>
<p>In multiplayer mode, we’ll hold monthly in-game events relevant to DAO news, events and popoular holidays.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-a-mobile-game-8" name="why-a-mobile-game-8"></a>Why a Mobile Game?</h2>
<p>Mobile games are easily available to everyone with a smartphone these days and have a wide audience range.</p>
<p>Those who play this game get to know <strong>Nouns DAO</strong> in a fun, interactive way and it is likely they’d  introduce it to their friends and other NFT lovers they know or meet.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#how-long-will-it-take-to-produce-9" name="how-long-will-it-take-to-produce-9"></a>How Long Will It Take To Produce?</h2>
<p>The early access version will be released after six months and then it will take three months more until the final release.<br/>
The game will be released through the <strong>App store</strong> and <strong>Google play</strong>.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-should-you-vote-for-this-game-10" name="why-should-you-vote-for-this-game-10"></a>Why Should You Vote For This Game?</h2>
<p>We feel like it’s time there was a completley nouns branded game that can introduce Nouns DAO to the rest of society.</p>
<p>The game model allows for a simple way for people to digest information about what Nouns DAO is and how it works, but also brings exposure beyond the Nouns ecosystem.</p>
<p>All of the content for this game will be open source and will be available to the public, so that we can update it over time and add more games and features to the game.</p>
<p>You’ve seen and love our work with the nounish music videos we’ve created, let’s make a game with even more impact!</p>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#marketing-11" name="marketing-11"></a>Marketing</h2>
<p>There’s a few ways we plan to market the game including:</p>
<ul>
<li>App Store Optimization (ASO): This gives maximum exposure to our game in the store by lowering our cost per install (CPI) and filtering high-value users. It all needs to have localized content (Keywords, Categories, Screenshots, and Video Trailers) per region and culture. This is a full-time job of a user acquisition manager excluding producing visual content.</li>
<li>Landing page: This is a one-page website where customers can learn more about our game. The landing page includes links to the App Store and Google Play Store, promo videos, a call-to-action, screenshots, gameplay trailers and reviews.</li>
<li>Different ad formats: Video ads, playable ads and rewarding video ads. Including all these three ad formats in our game helps us to not lose any potential of ads.</li>
</ul>

<p>Looks really really good.<br/>
My suggestion is make the game profitable, so you can reduce the value asked.<br/>
Things like placing other game ads or selling in-game items as nfts and give a portion back to the treasury. But that’s just my take, if anyone disagrees please let me know why.</p>

<p>You should share links to some of your prior work! I think you’re very talented and show off what you’ve built for nouns/lilnouns to date!</p>
<p>I’m glad you are considering going the Mobile game route. Feels like the best way to proliferate the meme to as many people as possible. Also going to be interested in how you will tell the story of Nouns individually and as a DAO collectively.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Arash</span> is an amazing artist. I agree with <span class="mention">@al409.eth</span> that you should share more of your work here. The prop is great but seeing your motion, sound and lighting work is important. FYI…Make sure you click the pics…that took me a sec to figure out…even though it says it right there lol.</p>
<p>NounsDAO will grow through many channels. Games and interactive digital environments will ultimately be one of the large growth drivers. Starting this journey with talented and nounish builders is something the DAO can afford and should be doing now. These projects are highly achievable and have large potential growth trajectories.</p>
<p>Adding profits to games is tricky I would assume. Perhaps that is easier via nft assets. Is that possible with current store policies? As for the game build requirements, cost and necessary team, I know nothing and will defer. I do think that there could be a few more details about the game environment, platform and technical requirements to interact in the future as a user.</p>
<p>Without adding revenue potential to the game, how will this project exist in the future? Will there need to be additional funding? Will the ad model fully fund in the future? What will be the requirement to manage that ad platform? Who sees what ads? What are nounish ads? Sounds like a straightforward model just curious. Not sure we have seen ads yet.</p>
<p>Using extensions in different levels is an excellent idea…and we hope there are wild crazy little FOODNOUNS running around and doing who knows what else…</p>
<p>The 20% Marketing budget is good. I think speaking to the CCO assets in those campaigns is important. DAO events in game is awesome and could be a fun way to on-board and learn. Seeing your work already, I know the marketing assets would be excellent.</p>
<p>Really hope we can support <span class="mention">@Arash</span> and Saeed in this build. Thank you for using discourse and asking for feedback.</p>

<p>We will have ads implemented as we mentioned in the proposal, and also there will be an in-game shop where players can purchase attachments and nounish skins. We have already reduced the asked value to the minimum we could, we even are going to use some of the pre-made contents of the DAO like 3d nouns and noun sounds to reduce the funds.</p>

<p>As you know, I’m a supporter and will continue to help where I can.</p>
<p>Great feedback from the others here.</p>
<p>I had a thought about revenue and potential to reduce upfront cost… maybe it’s possible to implement custom sponsorship ads. Where other nounish extensions, wallet companies and relevant sponsors could pay to have custom and tasteful ads placed within the game as well.</p>
<p>I personally dislike the ads that a lot of apps/games use and it’s a shame that it’s the primary method of revenue usually.</p>
<p>I love the skins and items idea and would love to see them created as NFTs so the user can own them and you have a source of revenue in collections of these and the players can verify their wallet within the app to use them.</p>
<p>Definitely need to keep the plain text links below all the images like in the hackmd. And agree with others here, we should add more of your work in a dedicated section with links to tweets and videos. Screenshots of popular tweets like the ones from 4156 would also be beneficial to add to the visuals here.</p>
<p>Feel free to share with me and I’ll add to the hackmd so it’s all in the markdown and you can edit/reply with edits on discourse.</p>

<p>I’m not well versed in gaming and its relationship to proliferation; however, I consider this game to be very nounish, in that its story incorporates the noggles and incorporates auction prices, minting and the winning process in the game as storytelling mechanic analogous to actual nouns minting process and cadence: “one noun, every day, forever”. The graphics are well done, and I appreciate the fact that this isn’t a reskin of another game.</p>

<p>Nice job and good use of the <a href="https://3dnouns.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://3dnouns.com/</a> undead head! I like the fact that you are building on top of existing CC0 nouns projects like 3D nouns and <a href="http://nounsounds.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NounSounds</a>.</p>
<p>I think you could progressively ramp up the budget using the different types of nounish funding mechanism as well. As an indie game, without the crypto layer, you could probably easily produce 5-10 out of the 700 levels (!) with DCS type of funding for example, and get some metrics to feed back the project and bring it to sustainability.</p>

<p>I really like this idea. As a contributor to Nouns Esports I’ve been thinking of ways to bring a party game to fruition for nouns because of the accessibility and ease of entry it brings to gamers. I think this is a great opportunity. There’s 2 things I’d like to see and I think Nouns Esports could take the ball and run with it on release:</p>
<ol>
<li>Steam launch. This game obviously is similar to Fall Guys and Stumble guys. Both with massive player bases. Fall guys is non-mobile and stumble guys is cross platform. Enabling this game to be cross platform on steam + mobile, then hopefully future consoles like the switch, xbox, and PS5 would be a grand slam. It’d put it hopefully in a position of quality in between the two games. Hopefully we would see some new course designs that don’t copy fall guys courses 1-1 and introduce new innovative hazards and player interactions in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Custom lobbies for tournaments. The ability to create custom lobby would allow us to host tournaments and integrate this game into our current noggles cup format(one of which we’re hosting this Saturday in Fall Guys with $11,600 in prizes for participants).</li>
</ol>
<p>If the budget would require more, absolutely ask for it within reason to build the most polished and engaging game possible.</p>
<p>Also, I would remove any corny references to web3 and crypto. References aren’t bad but onboarding gamers doesn’t need the added friction of our crypto buzzwords</p>

<p>Creating a Nourish Game seems like a great idea, but I have some concerns. To start Genius slackers does not have a functioning website, The proposal claims that the studio was created in 2016 but as far as I can tell they have only ever released one game “What Happened” to a very mediocre reception. How have they continued to fund themselves the past 2 years since their first game launch?</p>
<p>Modern games and Mobile games tend to run on a live service model so only having funding for 9 months seems short sited. How / who will be paying for the servers to support the online play after the game’s launch?</p>
<p>Without seeing more work from the developers, it’s hard to have confidence that they would actually be able to produce a quality game that represents the Nouns community well.</p>
<p>Is there more to the campaign mode to communicate what nouns is other than “After completing each level, the player is awarded three stars. The first star is just for completing the level and the second one is awarded if the count of collected ether has reached the winning bid amount and the last star is awarded based on the time spent completing the level.” while the minting mechanism is unique to nouns it does not communicate very much about the community or why someone would want to join or participate in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I appreciate the time and effort that went into creating this proposal, but it is my belief that creating a mediocre crypto game tends to hurt a project more than help them.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for such great and helpful feedback. Let me clarify some of the details here. We currently do not have a vision of selling NFTs via the app, but it is just the beginning.<br/>
The potential of a massive gamers community on the App Store and Google Play is noticeable enough not to worry about policy limitations of those stores on the blockchain, besides of that so many gamers may not have a deep understanding of blockchain, therefore we are going to focus on that community to produce the app as they wish and are familiar with.</p>
<p>We have added several revenue potentials like different formats of ads and in-game purchases through an in-game shop that players can pay for having different skins and customizing their game. there will be no need for any additional funding in the future unless one of these scenarios happens: 1- the number of users raised so high that the current support team would not be able to respond. 2- DAO would order a massive extension that had not been ever in our plan.</p>
<p>And more about the ads. Ads policies are different on each platform, but in general, they are in full control of stores and are programmed to be seen by the people who are interested in the context, I don’t know much about their algorithms.<br/>
There are different types of ads: Static ads, video ads, playable ads, and rewarding ads that the app stores provide us via APIs.<br/>
But Nounish and Nouns DAO’s content and ads can be a part of the game’s skin itself.</p>
<p>Using nounish extensions is a must for us, surely you’ll see something nounish doing WHO knows, where ever you look.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for the feedback. Let me address what you are concerned about one by one. We have temporarily made the Genius Slackers website inaccessible to upgrade it and will take a bit much to run it again cause we are doing it ourselves besides our other tasks.<br/>
On the other hand, what I have done since I entered the Nouns community that the DAO is aware of will be enough not to be concerned about a none functioning website.</p>
<p>As you said modern games and mobile games tend to run on a live service model and that’s why we use Microsoft PlayFab services which are free during development.<br/>
PlayFab Multiplayer Server builds automatically scale with your player base which means fewer players at less cost and more players during holidays at more cost, as we designed and calculated the cost per install (CPI) and optimized it by App Store Optimization (ASO) which at the end gave us a CPI of 1.5$ which means we’ll need 37,500$ to have 25,000 players. On the other hand, our in-app purchase design and ads revenue calculations will have revenue that will easily compensate the CPI letting us pay for the automatically scaled servers of PlayFab and more, you can learn more about PlayFab price sheet on their website.  We scaled the game to fit the time we proposed and want to maintain it after that with updates and upgrades.</p>
<p>“Without seeing more work from the developers, it’s hard to have confidence that they would actually be able to produce a quality game that represents the Nouns community well.”<br/>
Well, I Arash Negahban the director of the What Happened game released in 2020 on the Steam store with a clear resume and fame in the DAO am providing this proposal on the behalf of the team.<br/>
The quality of my work is well known and I am the person who is going to manage it all, so there must not be any doubt about the quality if you know my other works as high quality. honestly there is no more evidence for this particular case.</p>
<p>“Is there more to the campaign mode to communicate what nouns is”<br/>
I think we’ll hit the spot during 700 levels, ofcourse we’ll be open to any idea ordered from the DAO and we can add it to the game after having the required budget.</p>
<p>I appreciate the time you spent writing this helpfull feedback.</p>

<p>Thanks.<br/>
What we the blockchain users know about play-to-earn does not yet fit the outer market that is of course a pure market for games and gamers. There are a few other algorithms there to simulate the idea that does not fit the scope of the current proposal and needs more contribution.<br/>
We are not concerned about the future to propose multi-step funding as we are here in the DAO and DAO will not go anywhere except it takes us with itself, so when DAO decides that it wants it to be a play-to-earn, we’ll be there to negotiate.</p>

<p>Hi Arash, fellow game developer building web3 games in Unity.</p>
<p>Great proposal, I love the game mechanics, design and look of the game. Making a fun mobile game is challenging, however I believe your team can do it!</p>
<p>Here are my opinions as a game designer, hope these help your thinking…</p>
<p>Monetization:</p>
<p>Games funded by Nouns should try to become profitable, to support the ongoing running of the game once it is finished. Your prop has this, I love it! Let’s dig in…</p>
<p>Ads: a bad idea, because they will ruin the player experience AND you will only make pennies in return unless the audience is tens of thousands of players</p>
<p>IAP: in-app purchasing is a better way to monetize a game, but free-to-play often wrecks the game loop by stuffing it full of money asks (buy a big chest of fake coins, anyone?)</p>
<p>NFTs: for a game to be web3, THIS is the way. Using NFTs, innovating on a new model where in-game items can be shared across games. And NFTs could sell for a high price, providing ongoing funding to your project.</p>
<p>Game Platforms:</p>
<p>Seeing the game on iPhone and Android is excellent, better than Steam for sure.</p>
<p>Yet these mobile platforms are web2, centralized, and the app stores are gatekeepers. If your game uses NFTs, as suggested for monetization, it might be a problem.</p>
<p>The answer? I believe a web3 project should run in-browser first, iPhone second, Android third. And these 3 platforms cover 90% of gamers who want to try your game, it’s all you need.</p>
<p>And for web3 development (Metamask, NFT loading, NFT minting) the browser has full capabilities and mobile platforms are quite limited.</p>
<p>What to cut, to add NFTs and web?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Making 700 levels is going to eat tons of development time. Start with 70 levels (or less) that are fun, make sure players actually finish them all, add more levels later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrating ads, this will ruin the experience and gobble a bunch of development time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making an IAP system with “buy this chest of fake coins” monetization, this design takes tons of new UI screens, and the economics are very hard to get right</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would NFTs work as your core monetization mechanic?</li>
<li>Which game engine are you using, and does it support web publishing?</li>
<li>If your game engine doesn’t support web, why not build in Unity? <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Great proposal, I wish you well and hope to see this game made!</p>

<p>I love this!</p>
<p>Definitely think there should be more marketing budget for it though. You really want to push this game out to the masses we are going to need a bigger budget for marketing to get gaming social media influencers to push it onto their audiences. Ad spots for sponsorships is also pretty important / having the ability to purchase a premium pass to block ads. Also in game add ons are HUGE in free to play app store games.</p>
<p>Just my two cents. I love it but 100% need more marketing budget to push this to a large player base.</p>

<p>After reading it again, one major concern started to bother me:<br/>
You say the game is similiar to Fall Guys, but how much similar is it? Apart from the looks, I think the levels should be different enough to make the game original, otherwise it won’t be well received and people who already played fall guys won’t be interested in it. The key question should be: “What would drive people to play this game instead of Fall Guys?”<br/>
My tip is to take inspiration from another one or two games as well and mix it into a brand new concept, other option could be make the game much faster, by using vehicles like skate, rollerblades, kick scooters or bikes, another mechanics that tipically work well are things such as portals, antigravity, stopping time or even give one special ability to each character.<br/>
Some compatible games in which you can find inspiration are: Gang Beasts, Splatoon, Mario Party, Jet Set Radio, Lovely Planet, Katamari Damacy. and probably a lot more that I can’t remember right now.<br/>
If you are open to this possibility, I’m actually really good at ideas and implementing them, feel free to reach me if you run short of them, but I’m sure you will be able to have plenty of really cool ones just from this reply alone <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=12" title=":smile:" width="20"/></p>
<p>Edit: My last suggestion is to change the style of render to something more cybernetic or synthwave inspired instead of a matte finish, maybe start with a cartoony cel shading and later add neon and glitch effects on the levels and a lo-fi/vaporwave atmosphere on the sky, use a lot of white and don’t use more than 3 colors on each map!</p>

<p>It can really become something of a hit with a few original features that other games don’t have. Moreover, the more unexpected they are for this class of games - the cooler. As <strong>blueguy</strong> rightly said - blending the concept should give a positive start!</p>

1- As our target users and platform are general mobile gamers and App/Google store, and NFTs, and that kind of monetization does not fit them yet,  we do not have such a plan.</p>
<p>2- We are using UE5 which supports the web but yet you know the idea from answer 1.</p>

<p>Thank you for your awesome feedback.<br/>
Our first step toward marketing is to have 25k users and we can achieve this by spending 40k cause the cost per install is about 1.5$.<br/>
Your idea about the premium pass to block ads is great, we’ll definitely consider this.</p>

<p>I’m glad to see another gaming prop discussion going! As someone who’s also trying to develop a web3 game, it’s really cool to see the ideas other people come up with. Always happy to discuss and learn from each other in the nascent space.</p>
<p>There’s already been a lot of fantastic feedback already- a lot to unpack here. I’ve compiled some of my own thoughts about your prop:</p>
<p>Single Player:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I can appreciate how much time has went into creating the assets here. Looks like a lot of work. The fact that each level is customized to each Noun adds a nice personal touch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding the level design though, you state there is a unique level for each Noun minted, capped at 700 is that right? But what happens after the 700th Noun is minted? Do the levels repeat? You kind of left this open-ended. Maybe a more cohesive approach would be to make 242 levels, one for each head trait, that way all Nouns are covered in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like you changed the narrative of your game from a shooter to a platformer. Linking the gameplay to the Nouns auction mechanics was a clever choice and I think would be received quite well among Nouners as it could be fun and also educational in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My concern with this however, is that you’ve boxed yourself to a one-dimensional gameplay style. There is one objective and only one objective – try and complete the level with the fastest time. There is nothing wrong with this, but keep in mind this style of game is extremely popular so you’ll have a lot of competition trying to get people drawn to your game instead of theirs. As others have mentioned it could be beneficial to add unique mechanics like messing with the gravity or projectiles – something creative to differentiate yourself a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want this game to succeed as a long-term hit and elevate itself past just being an educational tool without much more depth of gameplay as shown, you’ll have to really fine-tune the mechanics to get them just right to be one of the top platformers on the market. Quite honestly from the demos you linked, the levels looked really easy by the fact that you didn’t fall once. Do you plan to have beta testing sessions open to the public to help you test and refine?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, refining mechanics such that they are <em>really</em> fun can take months, sometimes years to perfect. Let’s say in the event your proposal passes and you deliver the game, even hitting the 25k user milestone you mention. Would you still obligate you and your team to continue improving mechanics and level design outside the scope of this proposal’s funding? Or would that be another prop to improve/release new levels?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, generally speaking, if the game needs to be patched, reworked, updated, or otherwise changed due to unforeseen circumstances, does the funding of this proposal cover that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referencing the Nouns funnel, it sounds like you are trying to target the top of the funnel, i.e., the average everyday user – people who don’t know about Nouns or even crypto/NFTs. In which case, I don’t think it’s realistic to assume they will be innately drawn to the concept of Nouns, what they even are, how minting works, what is ethereum, etc. They might not care at all. This is why I would caution you to focus heavily on making fun gameplay mechanics first rather than simply relying on slapping the Noggles everywhere. That, or, you really need to make emotional connections with users by adding more lore/story. You can draw inspiration from previous props like Nouns stories (20, 180) or the Nouns book (83) on how you can leverage story telling in your game.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all I got written out neatly for now… I have more scattered thoughts in my head that I’ll need to sit down and formulate into questions later! Otherwise I think this has potential and am excited to see it progress</p>

<p>For some reason I thought Unreal did not publish to Web. Since it does, please think about making web a primary platform, with web3 features and a NFT angle. Such as connecting a wallet; loading NFTs; using them in-game; minting… to create a monetization model beyond ads and IAP fake coins.</p>
<p>I support your proposal and would love to see this game made. Good luck!</p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback.<br/>
Not only to reduce the budget but, 3D Nouns and NounSound are truly nice projects that we wish to take advantage of.<br/>
As an indie developer, we rather reduce the risk that’s why have counted on general gamers so, the crypto layer will be one of the last layers, I regret of course.</p>

<p>Of course, we are aware of what you are concerned about.<br/>
Game developers always try to find a title that best describes their title, the closest example.<br/>
That’s why we mentioned Fall Guys, It does not mean copy-pasting.<br/>
We mentioned that just to help people to get the overall idea.</p>

<p>Excited to see Nounish Playground come to life!</p>
<p>As others have mentioned, I love the core of your proposal and where you want to take it but my general feeling is that it would be better to break the proposal up into smaller chunks so that marketing and game beta testing can happen in between the steps with some cc0 benefits and community input can be sprinkled in there.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using 3D Nouns, preparing and integrating them into Unreal, the first proposal could be to convert all or some of the 3D Nouns assets to be used in Unreal Engine and make those assets available to the community as CC0 assets.</p>
<p>The next proposal could be to prototype a game with fewer levels using some of the Unreal-ready game assets from the first proposal and allow for beta-testing with the community to make sure the original game mechanics are worked out and get the community involved (always a bonus to help get larger proposals some additional support)</p>
<p>The final proposal could be something closer to the one you currently have; minus the budget for asset creation.</p>
<p>I know from the game development side of things its much easier to plan out an ambitious game project with a long-term budget and vision in place. If that’s what you’re looking for, you really need to make sure all of the above suggestions and feedback are addressed and your proposal is watertight with unique nounish game mechanics (at the very least) are worked out and clearly understood and on display in the proposal.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>
<p>Other than that, I’ve seen your 3D work and have no doubt that the quality of what you produce, in whatever form the proposal takes, will be top-notch, Nounish af and a benefit to the community… so you def have my support and good luck with it.</p>

<p>UE5 does not support the web — HTML5 support was dropped in 4.24 and there are no plans to bring it back.</p>

<p>I earlier said we are not planning web development. Of course, there are some open-source extensions allowing us to export for the web on UE5. On the other hand, we are capable to build the required tools for different tasks we need.<br/>
Ultimately, when it comes to discussing which engine is better in a professional session with professional people, the answers would be different, so forgive me to say I prefer not to discuss this particular case here.</p>

<p>It looks really exciting, although for me it’s more of a confusing concept. Educational games are cool, but I would look for a match 3 game with a unique visual style. It attracts a lot more audience due to its understandability. In addition, learning elements can just be built into levels or between them. But it’s like thinking out loud.</p>

<p>Thanks for such detailed feedback.<br/>
1-Yes each level will be unique.<br/>
2-No number of levels is not capped at 700, we guarantee we will continue adding levels for each new Noun when it is generated after releasing the game.<br/>
3-Yes, the previous plan couldn’t attract people enough.<br/>
4-Yes, we’ll have our unique gameplay ideas.<br/>
5- Don’t forget that we do not want to make a boring educational course. This is going to be an entertaining game that teaches entertainingly. The videos are just prototypes of the idea.<br/>
6-Yes of course, this is going to be a title that we will be proud of, so we surely continue improving what we have signed and gotten credit from.<br/>
7- That’s a broad question whose answer depends on different factors.<br/>
If that is about bug fixing, generally improving things that have not been improved enough, or adding more levels to the single-player mode as we had already promised then YES this funding covers that.<br/>
For massive updates and upgrades, we surely need additional funding.<br/>
8-Yes, our priority is entertaining.</p>

<p>This is amazing! I remember seeing Arash’s first game designs that was nouns shooter for example and few more followed by amazing music videos and other content for the Nouns DAO. Music videos itself in 3D is such an hectic work and he is able to deliver all of them flawlessly &lt;3<br/>
I personally think $200K USD is quite low for 9 months, this deserve more but nonetheless its nounish AF<br/>

<p>Very thoughtful proposal. For myself as a casual gamer, I’d probably be a user once or twice then be done. It’s hard to get something like this sticky within a group of users if the app is both Nouns tutorial and “fall guys clone”.</p>
<p>I’m more interested in seeing a mobile game that is purpose-built for an event that can bring millions of eyeballs at once.</p>
<p>Something like the 10 day competition Bored Ape Yacht Club competition “Apes Vs Mutants” on mobile or Finger on the App by Mr. Beast X MSCHF.</p>
