<p>Web3 Ceramics Studio that will explore what it means to be Nounish through quarterly Ceramic Collection Drops</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#what-is-it-3" name="what-is-it-3"></a><strong>What is it?</strong>
</h4>
<p>Nouns Ceramics Lab is an art and design studio dedicated to crafting Nounish clay objects- functional wares, toys, sculptures, and installations. Daily operations would include studies and experiments on clay in an attempt to come up with works that will answer the question, “but is it Nounish?” Successful studies will then be refined and batch-produced to become part of cohesive Ceramic Collections that will be released quarterly.</p>
<p>As an artisan’s studio within NounsDao, it will be one of the first traditional craft studios to operate within web3. As such, the studio will explore all the possible dynamics of on-chain art and physicals. All will be documented via the project’s website and select social media channels.</p>
<p>As the brand of Nouns Ceramics Lab is established, we will build and nurture a community that will share the love for anything Nounish and Nouns clay objects that promote it.</p>
<h4>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-pair-ceramics-with-nouns-4" name="why-pair-ceramics-with-nouns-4"></a><strong>Why pair Ceramics with nouns?</strong>
</h4>
<p>Ceramics is the oldest form of technology we have. Clay as a material can be adapted to a wide range of forms and has the rich potential to store meaning. To juxtapose both this flexibility and long-standing tradition alongside NounsDAO, is to further strengthen Nouns resolve to be pervasive and become a permanent fixture in our culture.</p>

<p>Hello! I’m heyMaya, and I learned Ceramics, Fine Arts, and Art History from my country’s top university. I then went on to become a Lead Product Designer for various US/EU/AU startups for the last 15+ years, and 5 years ago, picked up Ceramics again to get my hands dirty and through the process, found healing. My works on clay are influenced by Japanese / Asian pottery, Western modern iconography, and random quirky bits. I am recently inspired by the philosophy, work, and projects within Nouns DAO and I wish to share the beauty I found in Ceramics to promote the nounish culture.</p>

<p>Pretty interesting to combine Nouns branding with ceramic. Lovely.</p>
<p>Just some question, how will the ceramic studio sustain when the funds (25ETH) from Nouns combinator run out? Or will the ceramic studio set up as a 6 months only project? There will be 2 collection within 6 months, how big will these 2 collection be?</p>
<p>Love to see how this idea grow. Ceramic Noggles would be lovely!</p>

<p>Thank you so much, <span class="mention">@Wideeyekarl</span> and <span class="mention">@krel</span> ! Im so glad you pointed this out, great insight to focus on sustainability.</p>
<p>I’ve done a rough financial projections sheet— 25% of funding goes to capital costs and with a conservative market assumption on sales (25%) on 2 collections, this could possibly give us a cash runway for another 6 months.</p>
<p>So there’s a positive outlook at sustainability. And you’re right, I have to reconsider and tweak a lot of the variables which include size of the collection, frequency of release, scaling manpower, et. al.</p>
<p>I think I was also conservative on the 2 collections since a lot of product dev and testing assumptions will go into the first few months. Choosing to release 2 collections was a no-fail goal.</p>
<p>Sidebar— there are also other streams of income outside the quarterly dispatch for the studio to consider: creation of always on-hand essential goods, collabs with other nouns props or nouns-aligned NFT collections, collabs with brands, commissions within the hospitality industry, pop-up shops, and art commissions. Lots of experiments to be done. haha.</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, really appreciate you both. and for sure, it’s top of mind.</p>
