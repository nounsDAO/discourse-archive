<a class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-project-1" name="what-is-the-project-1"></a>What is the project</h3>
<p><strong>NFT the Future of Art</strong> is the first edition of a new ongoing event organized by <strong>Ethereum Honduras</strong>, aimed at presenting Honduran art as NFTs and holding a series of presentations on the world of NFTs, Ethereum, and Web3.</p>
<p>During the event, there will be a permanent exhibition of Honduran artists who have converted their works to NFTs and some outstanding NFT art collections. In parallel, there will be a series of presentations and panels regarding this new art form, NFT markets, how to mint art pieces into NFTs, and the Ethereum platform with its potential and many applications. With the intent of providing exposure to innovative Honduran artists, as well as empowering them and raising awareness of the amazing opportunities Ethereum can provide to Honduran society. The event is completely free and any purchase of art will be made through the proper channels, Ethereum Honduras does not receive money or charge for its public good activities.</p>
<p>The date is Saturday, December 10th at La Galeria, a happening shopping center that actively promotes Honduran art as well, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. The exhibition will showcase 10 Honduran digital artists that already have NFTs in the market and they will be selected by a panel of three curators (art managers &amp; collectors). During the 8 hours of exhibition, there will be 7 presentations and discussions going on.</p>

<ul>
<li>During the exhibition there will be screens showcasing NFT art, one of the screens will be devoted to the Nouns project, showcasing several Nouns characters as a successful example of generative NFT art, the DAO is free to pick which Nouns to showcase.</li>
<li>We also want to get people excited and have some cool <strong>nounsvision</strong> glasses that we will use to take some pics during the exhibition and will moderate a panel with them.</li>
<li>Many artists will be invited to listen to the ongoing presentations regarding how to mint art into NFTs, and how to promote &amp; sell NFTs. We will do a talk with Nouns as part of the agenda explaining how is a great example of experimenting with NFTs for governance and sustainable public goods funding.</li>
<li>Adding NounsDAO as an official sponsor and adding the logo in every art of the event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our desired outcome is to create awareness and promote interaction of the Ethereum ecosystem with the Honduran Artists. Our goal is to empower artists to start earning more with their art.</p>
