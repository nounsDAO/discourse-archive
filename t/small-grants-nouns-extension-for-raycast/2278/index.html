<h4>
<a class="anchor" href="#tldr-1" name="tldr-1"></a>TL;DR</h4>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong> To develop a Nouns Extension for <a href="https://www.raycast.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Raycast</a>. To allow users to get lightning fast access to Nouns related data. Trait explorer, collection data, auction, and more!<br/>
<strong>Budget:</strong> Ξ 2.5 to build (code, publishing, video demo) + Ξ 1 to maintain it<br/>
<strong>Prototype</strong>: I’ve already built a prototype to help illustrate how this extension would look and to get more familiar with the existing APIs. Below’s a a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMwFDnvEhCs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">YouTube video of the prototype in action</a> <img alt=":tv:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/tv.png?v=12" title=":tv:" width="20"/></p>

<a class="anchor" href="#description-2" name="description-2"></a>Description</h3>
<p>I’ve always loved Nouns and the NounsDAO, and always wanted to create something for it.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#initial-version-3" name="initial-version-3"></a>Initial version</h3>
<p>Recently I started playing around with <a href="https://www.raycast.com/store" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Raycast Extensions</a>, and it occurred to me that it would be nice to have access to the Nouns ecosystem at the tip of my fingers.</p>
<p>This extension could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to search for Nouns based on traits</li>
<li>Allow users to view the Nouns collection</li>
<li>Allow users to filter collection by ID</li>
<li>Allow users to filter by Nouns that are on sale</li>
<li>View specific Noun details</li>
<li>Open Nouns on OpenSea</li>
<li>Show users the current Nouns auction (include data, such as bidders, current price, etc)</li>
<li>Allow users to open current auction in browser</li>
<li>Show users Treasury value</li>
<li>Show posts from Nouns Discourse (subject to API)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The features above can be broken down into individual Raycast commands.</p>
<h4>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-raycast-4" name="why-raycast-4"></a>Why Raycast?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.raycast.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Raycast</a> is an app that provides developers with quick access to their tools. The app reduces the continuous context switching that millions of developers face every day with a command line inspired interface.</p>
<p>They’ve recently released an Extensions API. It allows developers to build custom integrations to speed up common tasks and share them with their team or the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tens of thousands of daily active users</li>
<li>Over 500 extensions in the store</li>
<li>More than 6,000 members in their Slack</li>
</ul>

<p>this looks awesome. we’ve had several trait explorers in the past but there’s not been one primary tool that everyone reaches for and this seems like a very solid contender. im also really excited the future version of this that can be a standalone site and be the slickest explorer anyone can use, and what can be added to a tool like this. the video looks great as well.</p>
<p>also exciting to have someone like Perdro building for Nouns given level of quality he brings to the table with his work…</p>

<p>yeah we can totally do that too! would require a bit more effort to make it really slick, but if we think the Raycast Extension offers good value I’d be more than happy to build the web version!</p>

<p>why raycast?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an excellent product, and they have an excellent developer API for building extensions. Raycast is growing fast and is <a href="https://www.raycast.com/careers#investors" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">really well backed</a>.</p>
<p>I like the idea of being one of the first NFT collections available as Raycast extensions too. I think it’ll help with having more eye balls on Nouns. But also, it’s just a fun extension!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i’d love if it were accesible via web browser. is that a big lift beyond what you have scoped out?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a bigger lift to build a dedicated web app since it’d require design, ux, ui and then the rest of the logic to make sure it’s properly executed. Such as routing, transitions, state management (probably include saving search filter in URL query strings so they can easily be shared), etc.</p>
<p>But there’s no reason why we can’t make a web version — will just take a bit longer!</p>
<p>Another note about making Nouns things for the Web, is that if Nouns had an official Design System, with pre-defined UX patterns, ets, it would definitely speed up the development, as well as ensuring consistency across products!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>also - i wonder if this may be a little too similar to something we are already funding that will be on the <a href="http://nouns.wtf">nouns.wtf</a> homepage<br/>
do you think your app would be meaningfully differentiated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some overlaps in terms of feature, since they can both search for traits. The main differentiator is that one is web and the other is within Raycast.</p>
<p>We could eventually even integrate the Raycast extension to open in the Nouns Explorer, so they feel part of the same family.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Also I’ve updated the budget in this proposal, as when I started writing it I wasn’t as familiar with the available Nouns APIs, but since making the prototype some things are a bit clearer now.</p>

<p>Big yes to this.</p>
<p>I think for a lot of people who are un-aware of what Raycast is [<em>and how most people who use it are major maxis of it</em>], this will get a bit lost on them.</p>
<p>That being said, as someone who is a Raycast user, I would use the **** out of this. Being able to have the Nouns information at my finger tips with the ability to look at traits, download pngs, etc, is amazing.</p>
<p>Re: the site browser. While these look to be similar on the surface, I would argue they are very different. Part of the Raycast UX is keeping things light, ontop of your current workflow, and readily available via keyboard commands at the OS level. Its like spotlight search on your iOS devices, but opened to developers.</p>
<p>The explorer on the website is a great add, but imo very different from what this provides. For example, when I’m designing Nouns stuff in Figma, I could go to the website and download assets from the playground and combine them how I would need, but its much more convenient to use the Figma plugin which offers similar functionally. It’s built into the tools and workflow I already use.</p>

<p>I love this idea. I actually considered building it myself after using the Raycast extension for Tailwind.</p>
<p>This could be a big workflow boost for many devs/designers. Unfortunately, the main obstacle is Raycast’s adoption rate.</p>
