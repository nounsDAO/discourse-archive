<p>Sharing draft proposal with the community for feedback before we go on-chain.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" href="#tldr-1" name="tldr-1"></a><strong>tl;dr</strong></h1>
<p>We are building a community of Nounish families, and creating a family focused mobile and web app to drive engagement. This family experience called FamilyNouns will make it super easy and fun to get families into Nouns and create Nounish things together.</p>
<p>The vision is to proliferate Nouns and do good for families across the world at scale. This prop is to creating a minimum viable experience of FamilyNouns, that includes effective community engagement, web and mobile app, characters and experiments in governance.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" href="#why-2" name="why-2"></a>Why</h1>
<p>So families create together, have fun together, learn together and most importantly proliferate together.</p>
<p>The fun, absurdity and accessibility of Nouns makes a rich creative space for different generations to create with each other. Bringing families together with FamilyNouns will benefit improved mental health, relationships, education and reduced stress. Our goal is for families to have more fun, do more good and spread more nounishness; and as a result, share the positive impacts with their friends, creating a positive self reinforcing loop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The best thing for me about Nouns in that my 9 year old daughter into it with me”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will make it easy for families to get involved in Nouns together, maintain motivation and create a simple on-ramp into Nouns, community governance and web3.</p>
<p><em><strong>Public Goods &amp; Proliferation</strong></em></p>
<p>Nouns has the potential to bring hundreds of thousands of families to create together and in doing so, can generate significant social benefit.</p>
<p>The family is a massive subculture that we can activate in a big way. Most families are already a bit nounish; they like to have fun and make the world better. We’ll make it easy to become fully noun-pilled.</p>
<p>Families are great proliforators, they tell other families, they play with each other and the meme gets spread. Families and young Nounish creators also make for great stories. This is the FamilyNouns flywheel.</p>

<p>We want to spread this Nounishness and bring in 100, 1,000, and 100,000 more nounish stories like these. We want to reach existing nounish families and those not yet familiar with Nouns and activate the Family subculture.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" href="#the-challenge-4" name="the-challenge-4"></a>The Challenge</h1>
<p>It is currently difficult for families to create on Nouns because there isn’t an experience designed for parents and children. From our experience as parents wanting to bring our kids into nouns there are 3 key reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Community experiences don’t work for the kids in our lives (twitter, discord, spaces etc)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They don’t have a profile</li>
<li>They content isn’t directed at them.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Finding and creating activities takes time</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Time poor families need it to be easy</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>When they don’t get feedback on their creations they aren’t motivated</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They want a place to share and people to care</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" href="#proposed-solution-5" name="proposed-solution-5"></a>Proposed Solution</h1>
<p>We will create a platform for FamilyNouns by nurturing a community, building an app, and developing an ecosystem for nounish families to come together, create and share.</p>
<p>This will be provided through an app (web, iOS and Android), discord and socials (collectively the platform). The app will be the main point of participation, we will use socials to engage with parents, and to share the families creations with the wider community.</p>
<p>The platform, focused on 4-12 year olds and their parents, will include the development of new activities, integrate existing Nounish family friendly activities, and bring future activities into a single experience that builds a strong family focused community.</p>
<p>To make the platform as accessible as possible we will focus on the nounish experience not the technology. It will be a Web2 platform in the first instance, focused on ease of use and enjoyment. Web3 elements are on the roadmap, with the intention for users to be able to ‘bridge’ their assets onto a web3 chain.</p>
<p>The focus for this prop is to get the core experience working well and becoming sticky with the beta testers who we are nurturing as the early adopters and core community.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#community-6" name="community-6"></a>Community</h2>
<p>We will build a community of families creating together with Nouns. This will provide encouragement, fun, friendship and support in the nounish family journey. Through this prop we will establish the early community of 50-100 families, some already nounish and some not-yet nounish, who will beta test the experience.</p>
<p>The Community will provide a place to <em>do things</em> together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contests to create together and then share with the community as well as collective efforts as a community</li>
<li>Gamified ecosystem that rewards users for daily activities and community engagement with native tokens, POAPs, and leaderboards</li>
<li>Creative ideas, thought out and prepared for busy families to easily start creating together. No fuss. No hassle. Just jump in. (“Family creative fun in a box”)</li>
<li>Encouragement for families to get together and do stuff</li>
<li>Activity collabs with other Nouns communities such as “baking cookies with Food Nouns”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Community will provide a place for <em>belonging</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A natural place and way for families to gather together in this new world of a nounish journey</li>
<li>A place to bring friends and families you know to share in the fun and creativity</li>
<li>A place to potentially reach out to “broken” families with a light of fun and creativity</li>
</ul>
<p>We will explore standard options like Twitter and Discord, but will also seek to creatively use tools that are natural to web2 families ranging from email to IRL and everything in between. How we do this most effectively for families will be an experiment.</p>

<p>Tiny Grants- micro grants to lil builders (Imagine kids getting funded to build!)</p>
<p>Prop House- families creating ideas and building together to grow FamilyNouns</p>
<p>Games like “How Would You Vote” to think and discuss….</p>

<p>ChrisCoCreated who is leading this prop for UglyNouns runs a government regulated care business in the UK, and has worked with vulnerable people for the past 20 years. It is something we have strong expertise in and is core to the way we are building.</p>
<p>Practically we are taking these steps in our initial release:</p>
<ul>
<li>All images and comments are pre-moderated by the core team before being visable on the app</li>
<li>Strict moderation of discord by the core team</li>
<li>All accounts are owned by an adult in the family. It is their responsibility to manage their children’s access</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" href="#success-13" name="success-13"></a>Success</h1>
<p>We will consider this phase of work on FamilyNouns successful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have established initial product market fit</li>
<li>We have a core engaged community regularly interacting with the app and community</li>
<li>We have developed the infrastructure for a wide launch</li>
<li>We have a wider community of family ‘guardians’ engaged and supportive</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" href="#future-plans-14" name="future-plans-14"></a>Future Plans</h1>
<p>This first phase will have developed the infrastructure for a wide launch after beta. The next phase we will continue to onboard families and develop family activities in order to reach thousands of families.</p>
<p>Will we be asking for more funds from Nouns DAO? This is of course an option we will consider, though we are also open to alternative funding routes, including establishing a FamilyNouns DAO.</p>
<p>We will continue to explore and build to activate the massive family subculture</p>

<p>UglyDAO has a public Discord where we discuss a wide array of different nounish ideas, such as FamilyNouns, for several weeks. This is where you can learn things about the team, the ideas being presented and the overall proliferation efforts that people have in mind.</p>
<p>The individuals spearheading the FamilyNouns Prop have also launched nounish projects, participate in multiple DAOs, take whole semesters to teach their university classes about DAOs and spend hours daily educating and onboarding people into this ecosystem. The children of these nounish individuals involved specifically in FamilyNouns have also launched nft projects, made nounish derivatives, have participated in nounish art contests for months and have even spoken on panels at crypto events. They are literally the future of this industry, which makes this app something that is for the <em>next</em> generation of builders.</p>
<p>This is something I am both impressed by and personally feel grateful for which is why I made the comment that “it feels like a no brainer that it comes from a team who consistently creates and shares fun nounish activities with their families”. As with anything that involves healthy childhood development, parents need to be involved, and it feels like this app could help build and create those experiences.</p>

<p>Great stuff <span class="mention">@chriscocreated</span>. Family Nouns is a wonderful concept and there could not be anyone better to achieve success. <span class="mention">@chriscocreated</span> is one of the kindest and most well meaning builders and individuals I have met in a long time. I do not have children, but if I did Chris would literally be someone I trusted them with wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>We should all be proud that we get to be part of an eco system that is driven by these initiatives. Nouns is the most family friendly space in NFTs. It does not compare. As we continue to do IRL and other types of on-boarding, we need to maintain our voice and positive vibes. This project will be part of that movement.</p>
<p>The prop is well done and clear. The mock ups look nice. Glad to see experimentation with apps being built with app builder programs. It allows for this entire project to fall into a certain funding range that is noticeably more affordable, while still offering strong functionality and branding. This of course does not work for all app builds, but I really appreciate the builder iterating an idea in the manner.</p>
<p>All around a big win for Nouns.</p>
<p>Great job <span class="mention">@chriscocreated</span>.</p>

<p>I love this idea. My kids love Nouns so much and constantly are asking for my phone to see the newest ones. I really would like to see some type of family friendly content get created for them (and me).</p>
<p>If I were prioritizing, I think I would rather not have the communication part be in the app at first until the other things were solid. Contests could be held based on simple emoji communication and not allow the freeform messaging outside of the adult discord. The more important things for my kids would be the things to do (in app and irl suggestions), governance questions to discuss, and the noundry with an export feature would be their <span class="hashtag">#1</span> request for sure.</p>
<p>I think if you focused in that way initially, you could prioritize the UX without having to worry about all the moderation activities. It would be the perfect fit for DCS at that point too imo.</p>
<p>That’s my two cents! I’ll be happy no matter what direction you go as long as it finds a direction. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/></p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A MEMBER OF THE UGLYDAO. I WOULD LIKE TO BE, BUT I WAS TOO ETH POOR AT THE TIME TO PURCHASE A SHARE. I HOPE TO ONE DAY BE AS UGLY AS THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMENTS. HOWEVER, I DID ONCE SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WITH THEM, BUT I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO REMOVE MY BIAS DURING THIS FEEDBACK COMMENT. I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF NOUNCIL AND WAS DIRECTED HERE BY A LINK FROM CHRIS THAT HE POSTED THERE. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED PAYMENT FROM CHRIS FOR CLICKING AND COMMENTING.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="mention">@AndrewLaddusaw</span>, scratching the same itch with my daughter here!</p>
<p>Fair point on the coms, I think ideally we would be in a place of providing specific feedback, and building deeper relationships, it would be a place we could cut back.</p>
<p>I’m not seeing how it would fit DCS though, there is still a large amount of community building work to be done without the moderation.</p>
<p>Appreciate the 2 cents!</p>

<p>Evidently not a good fit for DCS either way. Was hoping you could find another way forward apart from the current on-chain logjam. I’ll be cheering for ya.</p>
