<p>Dear Nouners,</p>
<p>Our first proposal! I’ve been digging in here and in Discord (Matto#1231) and very much appreciate the warm welcome so far. Thank you for taking a look at this and sharing your feedback, tips for iteration or anything else you care to!</p>
<p>Best,<br/>

<p>i think it’s is a great idea, and i appreciate the super thorough timeline breakdown. i also liked the Juicebox video from your channel.</p>
<p>i think nailing the tone is going to be the most important piece, since it’ll serve as a true “intro” to many new folks. will you try to work with the script from 4156 or write a new one?</p>
<p>i’m excited to see this progress!</p>

<p>Thanks for taking a look cdt! We’d definitely want to find an appropriate tone, and are open to feedback and collaboration on it. I spoke briefly with 4156 and would be happy to use the script he’s written as a basis for this. Normally we have a few rounds of feedback and rewrites to incorporate folks ideas so I think basing it off what he’s written would be a great place to start.</p>

<p>a lot money for a short period of time. Would love this figure to be challenged. (alternatively Mad realities can produce something much cheaper I believe)</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read and reply, really appreciate it.</p>
<p>We ourselves could also quote a much lower price if we had the sense that this was an organization with limited funds where something simple, cheap and quick was what was needed. My intuition, however, is that Nouns is a premium brand/meme and would want the same level of treatment that our clients at Google, Microsoft and Unity are looking for.</p>
<p>Investing more in making the animation means that we can profitably spend more time, effort and money on raising the quality and iterating on it with the community. There are many ways to do things that are really cheap, in this case we are proposing a budget that will allow us to create something high quality.</p>
<p>If the consensus is that something much smaller with a lower investment is desired I’m happy to submit something much simpler.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Great idea! Much needed! I also love the juicebox video, I feel like something similar, with an aesthetic that takes inspiration from the nouns website could work really well. I dont think the ETH amount is shocking, and if anything I would ask for more (ETH is at 1700USD today). This could help get the word out and explaining nouns in 4min isn’t an easy task (requires an understanding of crypto, smart contracts and DAOs). I would go for something that works with or without sound and with subtitles.</p>

<p>Thanks Orca for your support. And yep, with continuing dip in ETH prices we would need to ask for more since we’d be incurring fiat expenses to produce the video. Something that works with subtitles is definitely possible as well.</p>
<p>This is a video we recently created for the Terraforms by Mathcastles project which also has a high level of technical and conceptual complexity.

<p>This is a much needed asset and tool for onboarding and we need more of this. The ask is not a lot especially if we get to see a look/style proposal before a full commitment. I think it is a mistake to say “X can do it cheaper” because everyone has different strengths levels of quality work. Pushing on creators and builders to compete on pricing their vision against each other is very much a web 2 view of working and will drive away established builders that we want to work with</p>

    TLDR: Create an “Intro To Nouns” 3-4 minute animated video explaining what Nouns are, how the protocol mechanics work and how new contributors can get involved. 
Goal: To onboard people to Nouns and help them grasp the basics as quickly and clearly as possible. This video could be embedded at the top of the “<a href="https://nouns.center/intro" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Intro</a>” page on nouns.center or be an approachable resource to send to a friend who is curious about Nouns.
