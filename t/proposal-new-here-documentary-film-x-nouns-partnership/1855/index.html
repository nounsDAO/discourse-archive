<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#story-overview-5" name="story-overview-5"></a><strong>STORY OVERVIEW</strong>
</h2>
<p>Driven by curiosity and a growing disillusionment with the status quo, an isolated internet-user, <strong>ROOKIE</strong>, falls down the rabbit-hole of cryptocurrency and NFTs. On their kaleidoscopic journey, they encounter visionaries, dreamers, and revolutionaries who weave together a narrative of the most important emerging art movement of our time and the colliding ideals that it embodies.</p>
<p>As they explore the metaverse and meet the most influential creators of its culture, they confront the chaos and beauty of the virtual world and find a newfound appreciation for humanity.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#visual-language-6" name="visual-language-6"></a><strong>Visual Language</strong>
</h2>
<p>Part desktop documentary, part dreamscape, the film will blend live-action and animation to mirror the increasingly blurred lines between the physical and the virtual.</p>

<p>So is this an investment, a sponsorship, or is it paying for Nouns to have a more prominent role in the plot like product placement? If the former, how are you marketing and distributing the movie? Do you anticipate $3 million in revenue to make this a sustainable venture? I’m not sure why, but I just can’t quite seem to grasp the relationship here.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@krel</span> and <span class="mention">@AndrewLaddusaw</span>!  Thanks for checking out the proposal and for your thoughtful q’s.</p>
<p>I’m one of the producers on the movie, and wanted to respond to your questions and comments!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Re: 4156- yes, when we interviewed him for the movie in June, he knew it was for this movie and that he was being interviewed as a cast-member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re: <span class="mention">@AndrewLaddusaw</span>’s questions:<br/>
A) on the nature of this proposal – this is strictly a sponsorship proposal. It is not an investment or product placement opp. The $200K in proposed funding goes towards the overall production of the movie; however, we named the Nouns-specific production/story details we’re working towards, so the community can better see the relationship between our movie and the community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>B) Re: marketing and distribution: As of now, we’re aiming to premiere at Sundance '24, and we will work with a sales team to get the film sold upon its entry to the festival circuit. We have distributed previous work on Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon, Criterion, and we have a proven track record of turning a profit on our films. We aim to secure the widest distribution deal possible for the film.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@feverdreamer.eth</span> thanks for the proposal. I’m an executive producer of indie feature films, so welcome to Nouns! The main questions I have are–</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What if you don’t get into Sundance? What’s the plan? I know your a past winner but whats the backup plan?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the titles of the past projects you have distributed via “Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon, Criterion”? Did someone on your team distribute them directly, or did you work with a third party?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You mentioned a sales team, who are they, what is their rate (in proportionality to budget), and what past successes have they had?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As far as the documentary subject it seems like I’M NEW HERE has over 90+ interviews with artists and disruptors. That’s a ton of content, what is the main theme or thread that connects Nouns and how much anticipated screen time will Nouns have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Budget - The budget looks to be $3.25 Million USD. Can you provide a simple pie chart of your budget break downs and costs? I.e. 10% for Development, 20% for Pre-production, etc. And what is your largest anticipated expense?</p>
</li>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@rekola</span> would love to check out some of your work!</p>
<p>To answer some of your questions: our team has experience not only at Sundance, but at virtually every major festival. Besides Sundance, there are lots of great festivals where we could premiere the film, and it may receive offers for distribution before Sundance which may affect a festival premiere altogether. I’ve also premiered films at TriBeCa and Cannes and have great experiences at both. Success isn’t dependent on one festival, merely this is what timing looks like for us to submit a near-complete cut, and we have strong ties with the Institute and Festival. The plan is to get the film distributed once it’s complete. Working the festival circuit is what we’re familiar with, and would provide a great opportunity to bring the CryptoArt community further into the traditional film space.</p>
<p>I’ve personally sold my films to Netflix, Hulu, and Criterion. Criterion licensed two of my films, Netflix globally licensed MALA MALA, Hulu licensed DINA. Other producers on my team have worked directly with HBO and Amazon. I negotiated a few of those deals myself for MALA MALA, a sales agent and myself negotiated some for DINA. Happy to go into more detail, though it gets a bit granular.</p>
<p>A sales representative is a typical role for any independent film. I’m personally repped by UTA and they sell films all the time, Rhea Myers is a pro at this and they want to sell this film, though I’ve also worked with Submarine Entertainment, and they’re fantastic as well. The final decision for this role will be made closer to the films completion.</p>
<p>90+ interviews IS a lot, and that’s my process of doing the necessary research to make a film about a complex topic. I spent 3.5 years making my first film, MALA MALA, and that was a necessary part of the process for that film. A goal for this film is to showcase a wide spectrum of communities within this ecosystem, and to tell that story in various ways. Apart from including the voices of a few Nouners as well as 4156, certain animated characters will help guide this story. This is where I anticipate Nouns coming in. Apart from 4156’s interview being animated so they can appear as a full-bodied Noun, I’d love the world of the film to be full of Nouns, as they represent one of the most potent and vibrant communities in the space.</p>
<p>Happy to pontificate about why I personally love the Nouns project and feel as though a Nouns character-as-guide would align well with the values of the film, though that feels like another post/phone call.</p>
<p>We can provide a pie graph/breakdown of the budget ASAP.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great questions!</p>

<p>While I look forward to seeing the film, I don’t plan to vote for this proposal with current terms.</p>
<p>This seems lower leverage than the Stoopid Buddy proposal because:</p>
<ol>
<li>a wide variety of communities will be featured, diluting the noun-specific impact</li>
<li>the proposal is sponsorship-only</li>

<p>The proposal also requests a noun, which nearly doubles the effective cost.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="mention">@willprice</span> thanks for your input.<br/>
“A rising tide lifts all boats,” as the saying goes. There are many great artists and communities within this ecosystem, though the voices in this film extend beyond the top sellers as <span class="mention">@krel</span> mentions in their comment.</p>
<p>Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta, creators of blockchain tech, are collaborating with us on this film. We’re also highlighting the great work of thinkers like Joe Looney (Rare Pepes), Judy Mam (Dada.art), John Zettler (Rare Art Labs), Rhea Meyers, Sarah Meyohas, Cypherpunk Now, Jason Bailey…these are all brilliant artists and minds who quite literally ushered in the era we’re now celebrating. Surely they deserve a place in a film about this space. This is an ensemble film, as the history of this space (in my opinion) shouldn’t only come from one source or project. I don’t believe this dilutes the involvement of Nouns as much as honors them by placing them in conversation with a pantheon of ingenious humans and ideas. To the same point, none of these artists are operating a treasury comparable to NounsDAO, so this is an opportunity to support this ensemble (which includes NounsDAO) and be recognized for that support in perpetuity.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@krel</span> the film is currently in-production, and it’s a non-fiction film, so the outline will continue to evolve well into the editing process. One example where we’ll be playing with Nouns is in our interstitial moments, which will feature animation. As the rest of the cast comes together, that will affect how interstitials are used, so it’s a bit too early for me to comment on exact usage. We’ve also filmed all of our interviews in green-screen studios, so each environment will need to be fleshed out and will also include animations in the background. Imagine 4156 speaking as a full-bodied Noun with a playground of Nouns hanging out in the background <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/> in order to achieve this work in high-fidelity, we need to raise the budget.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@krel</span> - As far as why I love NounsDAO: 4156, David Horvath, and Gremplin taught me everything I know about the power of CC0 and networked communities, then manifested it through NounsDAO. I watched this project come to life last summer, and was so taken with the concept that I learned how to use Rinkeby Testnet in an effort to support the build (a new thing for me at the time). While I can’t yet afford a Noun, my Horvath and Gremplin pieces are some of my most-cherished, and this is why we also featured Cryptoadz in the teaser.<br/>
For me, NounsDAO embodies the ambitious and experimental spirit of the space: it’s decentralized, imaginative, built with with purpose, and fun.<br/>
This is why we’ve already contributed resources into including Nouns in the teaser for the film, this is why I was so excited to interview 4156, and I’m excited to interview David.</p>
<p>NEW HERE will be honoring the work NounsDAO does regardless of the outcome of this proposal, period. If we agree that there’s a need to communicate more about the context of this space and all the great work within it to a larger audience, we’d be honored to have NounsDAO credited accordingly as a supporter of the film. If we believe that it’d be valuable for Nouns to live in the same film as thinkers like Rhea Meyers, Erick Calderon, Raoul Pal, Mighty Moose, MOCA etc, even better! Nouns will be there either way.</p>
<p>This proposal is a gauge to see whether or not this community believes our endeavor is important enough to support with the resources required to make it great. As an admirer of everything this DAO has built, it would be an honor.</p>

<p>thanks for the thoughtful reply</p>
<p>your love for this project and cc0/nouns comes through and, while not yet convinced, I’m somewhat more inclined to support this now</p>
<p>i still think the ask is somewhat steep, however —</p>
<ul>
<li>i believe nouns might want to help sponsor this film, but not at 200E (plus noun?)</li>
<li>is there a way to turn this from a pure sponsorship to a proposal centered around the proliferation of nouns? not sure what that would be, but I’m searching for ways to more easily justify the pricetag</li>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@DanSickles</span> here’s my quick and dirty follow-up thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>You clearly are a solid filmmaker who knows how to execute.</li>
<li>You clearly respect Nouns and the larger web3 world.</li>
<li>You clearly are going to make a great doc.</li>
</ul>
<p>My concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rewarding sponsorship proposals with a Noun is a bad idea to me. Money is fine but for something that doesn’t actively proliferate the meme on a massive daily basis, nouns are a limited resource and must be protected.</li>
<li>Where is the money actually going to? You are in production so you must have substantial funding in place. What is the cost of ATL? What is Post-costs etc. Can’t wait to see that pie chart</li>
<li>Is any other web3 community already committed financial sponsorship? Who are they?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Medium Approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a executive producer, maybe I’m thinking outside the box here, but is there a world where Nouns can fund the $200K USD further down the line. Say in distribution, when a final cut is available? That way we as a community can see it and y’all can have a guarantee towards distribution costs, theater rentals, marketing materials, etc.  Is there a reason you need the funds now, immediately?</li>
<li>Maybe do something like splitting the proposal between $75K USD now for production costs, and then the remaining $125K will be voted on around distribution and approval of the cut?</li>
<li>Maybe do something like Nouns specific screenings. Meaning we agree the sponsorship fees goes towards industry press screenings, national screenings when time is ready, and more. That way even if nouns is in the story being the sponsor of the events that have press will push the meme further.  Like a nouns funded roadshow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any-ways, I’m torn as is. I like the project. Is this a competent filmmaking team? Yes. Does this fully proliferate the meme? To some extent, but not enough in my eyes. This is a sponsorship proposal. Yet you ask for a Noun when we’re already CC0. If you need more money-- ask. I’d like to see some evolution on the proposal and quote unquote business plan to proliferate the meme and where the money is actually being spent.</p>

<p>I see where this proposal is headed and I just needed to hop in and express how disheartening these responses are from the Nouns community.<br/>
Here’s an excellent team that has actually delivered high-quality, awarded work in the past. They’ve already spent time on the ground, they’ve spoken with voices who are exclusive to the project, and yet the scrutiny applied to this great proposal is misguided at best.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@rekola</span> I’m curious, what films have you EP’d and what were the budgets? As a veteran in the film industry myself I’m wondering what your experience is here.<br/>
This team has discussed distribution and their experience there, yet you propose setting aside a budget for distribution in response? If you’ve EP’d a film that’s sold to a theatrical distributor or streamer, you’d know there aren’t distribution costs associated with the film once it’s licensed, the film is licensed to be distributed. There are cases in which a distributor is paid to distribute a film, though 90% of the time that deal is coupled with a streaming deal to qualify the film for the awards circuit, and all of that (typically) is negotiated by a sales agent on behalf of the film team.<br/>
Unless I’m reading this wrong, the film team is asking for support to complete the film, not self-distribute it, of which your suggestion of $125k would do very little if self-distribution were the goal.</p>
<p>Compared to the other films Nouns has sponsored, this is a home run imo. This DAO has supported live-action films by first time directors thematically not at all related to crypto, yet somehow this proposal is received with skepticism. I applaud Dan and his team for responding patiently.</p>
<p>Overall, I worry that the wrong people are scrutinizing this project and the chances this proposal has to receive support will suffer for it. It’s important that this dialogue is on the record, I fear this myopia won’t age well for the NounsDAO community.</p>
<p>Seems like this DAO would much rather spend exorbitant money on short-term gags.</p>

<p>hi, thanks for the thoughtful proposal.  i have read it over multiple times now and i am still unclear what this film is about or how Nouns would be featured in it.  it sounds like you have done a lot of interviews with people in the NFT space, but do you have any details on what this film is actually about?</p>

<p>I don’t know who made a new account to post this, but it may not be the best strategy for you to belittle and threaten people in the DAO for asking questions for not blindly supporting this proposal.  You are coming to <strong>US</strong> asking for almost $400k in funding, not the other way around.</p>
<p>I unfortunately do not support this proposal.  I would potentially support it at a lower cost once we have more details on what this film is actually about and how Nouns will be integrated, beyond an interview you conducted with 4156.</p>

To be honest, in a year pitching this project, we’ve rarely had an issue communicating what the film is about, so apologies if that’s been lost in the NounsDAO proposal, though the story overview is below from the original post.

</aside>
<p>I’d say that interstitials are more than transitions, they’re actual mini-scenes (Adam McKay uses these very well, and they’re some of the most memeified and remembered moments in his films). These, in addition using Nouns in virtual backgrounds are two clear-cut examples I gave for how Nouns would be used, though there are other sections of the film in which the virtual world blends withe the non-virtual, and these moments will also include animation and characters (akin to Roger Rabbit). Again, there are a few Nouners apart from 4156 who have already been interviewed, and David Horvath is also on the schedule to be interviewed.</p>

<p>A goal for this film is to showcase a wide spectrum of communities within this ecosystem, and to tell that story in various ways. Apart from including the voices of a few Nouners as well as 4156, certain animated characters will help guide this story. This is where I anticipate Nouns coming in. Apart from 4156’s interview being animated so they can appear as a full-bodied Noun, I’d love the world of the film to be full of Nouns, as they represent one of the most potent and vibrant communities in the space.</p>

<p>what i am asking is - what is the plot of this film?  you reference the story - what is it?  you have conducted a lot of interviews, but it doesn’t sound like the film’s plot is a single character going around and interviewing 90+ people in different NFT communities about the history of the space?  your ‘teaser’ is just a bunch of people’s names. right now you are saying the protagonist goes on a journey and meets people, but i am hoping to understand the broader plot of the film, as well as Nouns role it in, before I would have enough information to consider funding such a large ask</p>

<p>Curious <span class="mention">@noun22</span> why you put my work in quotes. It’s a pretty universal sign of condescension, which I imagine you know.<br/>
The teaser you speak of has a lot more going on than “just a bunch of people’s names.” It’s a taste of the work we’ve done over the past year to get the community excited about the project, and includes the work of a lot of wonderful artists (Deafbeef being one of them). Coordinating all of that talent is a production feat in and of itself, though it’s your choice to disrespect it or deem it insufficient (this is your community forum after all).</p>
<p>As for what the film is “about.” It seems like you’re asking for a full treatment, which I can’t share publicly at this time, the same way a screenwriter wouldn’t publicly post their script publicly while in-production. I am, however, happy to walk though more of what’s happening in the film on a call or in another forum. I’ve mentioned two specific use-cases for Nouns in the film already.</p>
<p>For clarity, the film is centered around a new-users experience (hence the film-within-a-film container). As this user falls into the cryptosphere, they learn more about the space and various communities within it. We’ll be using this character’s laptop as a portal into interviews and scenes. In this way, it’s an experiential film, and we witness this user become a collector, create friendships, and ultimately afford their grail piece. A lot of this is also mentioned on our site newhere.xyz</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your input and good questions on our proposal.</p>
<p>We are going to take your feedback, and we’re going to rethink this. We’ll soon post a v2.</p>

<p>This feedback is all valid. I wish we framed it as “let’s figure out how to make this happen by having more detailed conversations and getting a better understanding of the moving parts and long term vision” vs “we don’t want it unless you can prove it’s worth it”.</p>
<p>Let’s be more creative about how to help get this over the finish line because this could be really cool.  I totally understand what they’re saying with how the film plays out and uses Nouns as a narrative theme throughout the film.  Almost as if it’s told through a Nounish perspective and framing all this craziness we’ve experienced as leading up to Nouns which is basically the end of the beginning of this first NFT boom.</p>
<p>If we embrace ideas like this and lean in, offer community support, rally a bit while also being critical just imagine what might happen?  I’m 100% for candor and it’s everyones right to ask for as much clarity as they need but we have to find a way to do it that makes the creatives coming to us (a very real privilege) feel embraced and valued regardless of how the funding decision goes.</p>

<p>Thanks for your thoughtful reply <span class="mention">@joshuafisher</span><br/>
We’re reworking the proposal and will resubmit. Hopefully the new proposal is clearer as to what the needs are, and Nouns can see the value of supporting this collective story being told.<br/>
Excited to post the next version of our proposal. Thanks again.</p>
