<p><strong>Proposal:</strong> Nouns Rap Battle</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Celebration of an interactive live remote rap battle, at the end of the battle an NFT will be auctioned. The NFT will contain both artists, nouns sunglasses and a nounish design ⌐◨-◨.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>To support new emerging artists and let people discover them I thought it would be fun to give these artists some nounish power ⌐◨-◨. We will host a live remote rap battle in which the artists will be freestyling with a nounish background. To get an idea: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dak7WhGfv0&amp;t=270s" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Best Freestyle? (J. Cole, DaBaby, Juice WRLD, Lil Baby, Tory Lanez, G-Eazy)</a>
</li>
<li>The rap battle will be interactive, meaning that in <a href="http://OpenBeats.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OpenBeats.wtf</a> watchers are going to vote on the structure of the rap battle and which themes they are going to rap about.</li>
<li>At the end of the rap battle, watchers will vote for the winner and a NFT will be auctioned in <a href="http://OpenBeats.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OpenBeats.wtf</a> which will contain both artists, nouns sunglasses and a nounish design ⌐◨-◨.</li>
<li>In case you were wondering WTF is OpenBeats. It is a long term project I am building which looks to solve today’s music problems (streaming economy doesn’t pay) from a Web3 perspective. If you want to find more: <a href="https://twitter.com/ferrodri_dev/status/1590697393061699585" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/ferrodri_dev/status/1590697393061699585</a>
</li>
<li>While starting OpenBeats by coincidence I met nouns and I got fascinated. My objective is to build OpenBeats on top of Nouns, something similar to what Gnars has done. So, to use Nouns brand in my own brand.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How will this proliferate Nouns?</strong></p>
<p>Emerging artists and fans will discover Nouns and its nounish vibe. Furthermore, this is the first step and a proof of concept towards improving the fan to artist experience while supporting emerging artists, a win-win model for artists and fans in which they both grow.</p>
<p>If this works out further actions will be done from OpenBeats which will support a nounish vibe everywhere (logo, marketing, website, etc). Our long term goal is to build the next Web3 music app with Nouns as an image and culture ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>Funds and structure of the project:</strong></p>
<p>The project deadline is January 11th 2023 in which we will celebrate the streaming rap battle.</p>
<p><strong>This project funding can be done in three tranches</strong>. Upfront I really do not need funds, just to validate the idea with the nounish NSFW team. After a positive response, this will be the work that has to be done.</p>
<ol>
<li>Smart contracts, backend and frontend code that has to be done in order for the interactive rap battle and NFT auction to work. I will do this myself and calculate this as 5 weeks of work. Funds: 4ETH. I could ask for 2ETH upfront to start coding.</li>
<li>Hire a designer for the background of the rap studio, the NFT and some cool marketing. Funds: 0.5 ETH.</li>
<li>I am not a native english speaker, even though I am proficient, I believe a native presenter who has a hip hop background or vibe will do it much better. Funds: 0.25 ETH.</li>
<li>Rent two music studios for a couple hours. Funds: 0.5 ETH.</li>
<li>Regarding the artists, the idea is to have them come for free and let them earn from the NFT auction, however, I have not talked with them yet, so this will be a pending expense. Maximum budget per artist will be 1ETH. I have previous experiences hiring artists for private concerts.</li>
<li>Regarding marketing, the idea is to have the artists promote it as well, however some funds could also be needed to promote the event. This will also be a pending expense after interacting with artists. Maximum 2ETH.</li>
<li>Management of the project all done by me apart from the code: 1ETH.</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea from the NFT auction is to divide the proceeds between the artists and future OpenBeats treasury, which in this auction will take a maximum of 30% to fund future activities. It depends on the artists, OpenBeats might not be able to get any funds from this NFT auction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if this works out, there could be a weekly rap battle or even an annual competition with a final IRL event sponsored by Nouns and OpenBeats.</p>

<p>Hey Ferrodri, this is an interesting proposal. I read through your Twitter post as well. May I ask as the Founder of rentalplus.es, with an exceptional revenue success and the understanding of creating a web2 business does it not make sense to create <a href="http://OpenBeats.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OpenBeats.wtf</a> and then to approach Nouns with a proof of concept?</p>
<p>I would debate that if Nouns is funding the creation of the project, shouldn’t the name have Nouns in it, otherwise Nouns is funding you to create your brand to a certain degree?</p>
<p>I do not have an issue with the ask etc, just a thought I had after reading your bio.</p>

<p>Hi RGB-NOUN!</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback and reading my proposal, I appreciate it a lot.</p>
<p>Regarding your first question:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-post="2" data-topic="3027" data-username="RGB-NOUN">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have been deeply studying Nouns last week and from what I understand, there is a great advantage to submitting a proposal before building a proof of concept. The following apply to this case in my opinion:</p>
<ol>
<li>By submitting the idea in the discourse I am going to get some feedback on the product and idea. I could get some feedback in other places, however, the nouns culture makes it so that all of us want to proliferate nouns. Therefore I believe it is a much more qualified feedback, as the one you gave me.</li>
<li>By building with Nouns I solve in a better sense the cold start problem, since I already count with an initial community, some funding and even some talent if anybody likes the idea and wants to join. For example, a designer from the nouns community will be great. Furthermore, if I receive some positive feedback from the nouns community now it seems like they will be attending the live event on January 11th 2023. <a href="https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1592189447260577798" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1592189447260577798</a></li>
<li>From the nouns perspective, I think in this case, it is great to participate on an emerging idea in the web3 music industry, which could later on result in a great hit, therefore proliferating Nouns.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, I think doing it counting with nouns participation will achieve a better result for both parties than doing it individually.</p>
<p>Regarding your second question:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-post="2" data-topic="3027" data-username="RGB-NOUN">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt="" class="avatar" height="24" loading="lazy" src="https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/user_avatar/discourse.nouns.wtf/rgb-noun/48/3703_2.png" width="24"/> RGB-NOUN:</div>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://gnars.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">gnars.wtf</a> after meeting 0xigami IRL. I am open to changing the name after receiving more feedback. It could be OpenBeats⌐◨-◨ or even I could rename it.</p>
<p>For me, at this point, the concept is more important than the brand name itself. Building with Nouns is great as I believe it is the first decentralized brand with a win–win model, both for the DAO and future brands building on top of nouns. So at this point, I am totally open to debate about how we should market the name of OpenBeats or even change the name. I thought, as I put in the post, that the logo should have nouns sunglasses 100%</p>
<p>How would you name OpenBeats for this purpose?</p>

<p>I don’t have any thoughts on the name etc, would take some time to think it through, but I’m not the best candidate for this part of the discussion. Have you had a look at the other Nouns music related projects? There are quite a few cool ones already out there in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>I’m trying to understand the end game for your product. Do you want to be a web3 spotify with the revenue in the creators hands rather than a central company?</p>
<p>If so, they made 3 billion in revenue last year and still lost 166 million dollars.</p>
<p>It’s a very tough industry. I’d love to see it disrupted, but without gathering a huge amount of artists and users quickly, it is very difficult to scale.</p>
<p>Maybe building some type of decentralized protocol for music sharing would be fundable as a public good, but I don’t feel like this idea is far enough along or nounish yet. I agree with the comments above that building out the website and idea would help a lot for the community to be able to see the vision and continue to support your efforts, even if it’s just a sounding board for ideas as you build.</p>
