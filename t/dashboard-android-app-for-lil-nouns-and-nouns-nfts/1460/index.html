<p>This proposal (<a class="inline-onebox" href="https://prop.house/proposal/407" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Prop House</a>) intends to allow me to work full-time in order to build a Dashboard Android App for Lil Nouns and Nouns NFTs at a fast pace. This app will be developed under CC0 terms, completely free and belongs to the entire nouns community.</p>
<p>Once approved, I will work on this project full-time all the week days till the app is published in the Play Store. I also compromise myself to make diary commits and show the app advance one time a week to the appropriate channel chosen by you from Lil Nouns. I guess an app like this will need about 2 months to build.</p>
<p>I am a software engineer with almost 30 years of experience. I have been coding in many languages as C, Cpp, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Javascritp and so on with various APIs, frameworks, wrappers, OS and devices like Android, IOs, Windows Embedded and Linux Distributions. I am, currently, doing my transition from Web2 to Web3.</p>
<p>The fund can be sent in small amounts while I am building the app.</p>
<p>I love all the Nouns ecosystem and I am working to belong to this community and to be able to contribute the best I can.</p>
<p>Thank you all nouns frens for your consideration in this proposal.</p>

<p>This is an interesting one, being that the focus is not only on nouns, but also lilnouns.</p>
<p>I’m all about an open source CC0 app and codebase though, as it would likely be useful for many nounish extensions.</p>
<p>But what exactly is this dashboard? Features, functionality, use case and some info about the app specifically would be helpful to understand what it is you plan to build I think. Even some design mock-ups would surely help this become clearer.</p>

<p>Hi fren!</p>
<p>Excellent observations!</p>
<p>From Stephen Few,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dashboards are a powerful way to get data-based intelligence using data visualization that show relevant, actionable data and track stats and key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>
<p>So the main idea here is to provide insights to the nouns community as well as visual information which can be used in many ways like marketing for example.</p>
<p>Initially, I intend to build a basic app that shows Nouns and Lil Nouns data visualization using basic but important data.</p>
<p>The features for this app initial version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A graphic view of generated data visualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procedure that permits connecting a wallet account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procedure that permits exporting the used data as a csv file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procedure that permits exporting the graphic as an image file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procedure that permits selecting the data source (Nouns and Lil Nouns initially).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procedure that permits selecting the date range (m, d, w, y)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The development will be built as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A modular structure that permits the implementation of new nounish projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cross-platform technology to easily deploy the app to other platforms like IOs for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of Python in data processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of Nouns API to keep the integration between the projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CC0 terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A public repo with total permission to the nouns founders or those the NounsDAO and LilNounsDAO choose to follow the development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of Agile and Clean-Code methodologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequent reports and meetings with the nouns responsible for the project supervisioning</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obs1: The Agile methodology implicates flexibility so the app can be modified as the suggestions and considerations may happen.</p>
<p>Obs3: The english language grammar, nouns expressions, nouns colors,nouns fonts, etc are resources provided by the nouns responsible for the project supervisioning.</p>
<p>Obs2: The app publishing in the Play Store or any other platform will be done just after the NounsDAO and LilNounsDAO approvals.</p>
<p>This is a basic mock-up drawn by me (sorry for my poor drawing skills rsrs)<br/>

<p>Thank you for such a detailed response! I think this will be helpful for anyone else looking into this prop <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/></p>
<p>Would love to see the code open source in a public repo for other forks and extensions to potentially use as well.</p>

Hope I can build it at a fast pace the fund (2ETH) will allow me.<br/>
If not possible, I will do it in the my disponible time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am grateful for your attention and observations <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/></p>

<p>I think this is a great thing you’re aiming for, with quite a low budget.<br/>
I hope to see this come to fruition and then more of your work in the future.</p>
