<h2><a class="anchor" href="#p-15648-simple-summary-1" name="p-15648-simple-summary-1"></a>Simple Summary</h2>
<p>NounsVision is a biweekly content series designed to bridge the information gap between Nouns DAO governance forum activities and social media platforms where most community members are active. The initiative transforms governance discussions into accessible, engaging content including main videos, short-form clips, monthly research reports, and accompanying social posts that inform Noun holders about governance activities they would otherwise miss.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#p-15648-motivation-2" name="p-15648-motivation-2"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>Currently, there exists a significant information vacuum between governance activities happening within the Nouns DAO forums and social media platforms where most community members spend their time. Many Nouns holders remain unaware of key governance proposals and discussions simply because they don’t regularly check governance forums or attend community calls.</p>
<p>This proposal addresses this critical information gap by bringing governance content directly to the platforms where community members are already active. By transforming complex governance information into accessible, engaging formats, NounsVision ensures that important DAO activities aren’t confined to governance forums that many users never visit.</p>
<p>The consequences of this information vacuum are clear: community members who are active on social media but not in governance forums remain uninformed about important protocol developments and decisions. The Nouns DAO deserves consistent, high-quality content that brings governance information to the platforms where the community actually spends its time.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#p-15648-specification-3" name="p-15648-specification-3"></a>Specification</h2>
