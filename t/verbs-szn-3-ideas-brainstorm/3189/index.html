<td>delegate override</td>
<td>this feature would allow token owners to override votes cast by their delegates.<br/>the motivation is security, as owners have more skin in the game, and therefore more likely to vote in good faith and be less susceptible to bribes.<br/><br/>our initial design work showed us this feature is far from trivial, with the downside of allowing Nouners to abuse the system by delegating to themselves and preserving the right to edit their vote.<br/><br/>we might come up with a design without this flaw with further research.</td>

<p>Spectacular. Always great to know that Verbs are on it. Knowing that these updates can be added to sub-dao stacks is truly inspiring and humbling. These are the robust building blocks that make NounsDAO eco system so special and hard to understand for most project leaders, “DAOS” and NFT “maxi”.</p>
<p>It is hard to overstate the innovation that is happening in these updates and contracts. Most other NFT projects have zero tech…a simple “get lucky” dapp, and that’s it…the remaining holder experience is a Token Proofed event…a few times a year. That is 99% of NFT projects.</p>
<p>Thru Verbs, we are going to see automation, filtration, customization, modulation; as well as audits and on-going proper maintenance. Thank you for all the hard work and big brain. These features, voted on and baked into the CCO code stack, are the foundational tech elements that all other tech builders in the eco system rely on to grow and innovate.</p>

<p>This is a great list of upgrades. Thanks for compiling it.</p>
<p>I think standardizing a multisig and milestone system for the DAO (<code>milestone-based proposal payments</code>) and <code>increase on-chain transparency for multisig / pod spending</code> are both important longer term goals. The adhoc systems that are in place right now more or less work: an assessment of trust is made when the proposal is being voted on, folks like maty keep an eye on spending, and we haven’t had any major issues.</p>
<p>However, we do have a gap in technical capabilities for proposal creation for holders and delegates with 1 vote. Currently there is high friction for single vote holders to coordinate and get a proposal on-chain. For single vote delegates, it is currently impossible to coordinate because they do not have the ability to re-delegate to another address. I believe the tools developed for <code>autonomous proposals</code> would empower a larger number of voters than any of the other ideas in the backlog and so would advocate for bumping it to HIGH.</p>

<p><strong>Airdrops</strong></p>
<p>The DAO has had a long standing issue where it cannot easily pay for proposals in Nouns directly. In the past, we’ve had to instantiate a trusted acquisition committee to acquire nouns, which had the effect of dissuading and blocking new entrants: it was also a cumbersome process generally.</p>
<p>I would love to see <strong>Aidrops</strong> implemented as a direct and scalable solution to this problem: the DAO can issue new Nouns outside of the daily auction via proposal.</p>
<p>This would allow the DAO to easily include Nouns as compensation in proposals, which may reduce the amount of ETH that needs to be spent as well as align incentives for the long term.</p>
<p>By ensuring this can only happen by proposal, the DAO will only issue these Nouns if it thinks the proposal will create more value than the dilution.</p>

<p>Great GDoc on Ragequit. Good coverage and very well thought out.</p>
<p>To make sure I got it right –</p>
<ol>
<li>Ragequit serves as a mechanism against 51% attack assuming that the quits can be executed on demand faster than the prop voting delays.</li>
<li>Does not serve against a different attack vector where the attacker finds vulnerability in the contracts and circumvents transacting through the regular prop flow.</li>
</ol>
<p>More than mitigating the 51% attack vector, seems more likely to be implemented due to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Great mechanism to justify getting rid of the veto.</li>
<li>Nouners that bought in cheap wanting to arbitrage for bv, or at least have exit liquidity at bv which is 96% above secondary floor price.</li>

<p>Can you help me understand why we would want a ragequit mechanism versus unhappy people just selling their nouns on secondary? I don’t think I’m understanding the purpose of it or how it protects against a 51% attack at all.</p>

<p>Secondary exit liquidity is low because you can always just buy the next Noun.</p>
<p>Ragequit enables exit liquidity to near or at book value on demand.</p>
<p>It protects against a 51% attack assuming that everyone gets a chance to quit the DAO and get ETH back before the 51% attack can take place, assuming that the attack takes place through a DAO prop which will have an inherent delay before it is executed and the attack actually takes place.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct. Ragequit would either be possible to call immediately, or during a proposal’s timelock delay.</p>
<p>It also serves as a protection in case the veto gets captured. One would be able to ragequit in case a proposal is vetoed.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Does not serve against a different attack vector where the attacker finds vulnerability in the contracts and circumvents transacting through the regular prop flow.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Correct. Hard to protect against smart contract vulnerabilities with smart contracts.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Great mechanism to justify getting rid of the veto.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It has pros &amp; cons compared to the veto, but it opens up the possibility to change/remove how veto works.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Nouners that bought in cheap wanting to arbitrage for bv, or at least have exit liquidity at bv which is 96% above secondary floor price</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The financial/price impacts of ragequit can’t be ignored and would need to be taken into account. In the gdoc we tried to outline the different possibilities there.</p>

<p>Had a bit more time to read through the list after I initially just commented on the ragequit research doc.</p>
<p>Regarding priorities, I would love to chime in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gas refund on prop execution is  a nice-have, but I would probably move to medium given other titles that would have higher impact and limited dev bandwidth.</li>
<li>Same for increase on-chain transp for multisig spending – nice have but its audit use would probably not be that high, so medium.</li>
<li>Vote editing would make higher priority as a heavy voting block could accidentally sway a prop the wrong way. I’ve already voted the wrong way on some props, so I know what it feels like.</li>
<li>Private voting is probably the highest impact of them all imho and should be moved to high, as I have a hunch that various props are passing that wouldn’t if it weren’t for social consequences. I would be interested in lending a hand in finding and producing a ZK voting solution for the DAO.</li>
<li>Proposal description amendments and even prop transaction amendments before voting I would move to medium.</li>

<p>The rest looks great to me.</p>

<p>Hello! very excited to see you guys thinking about what’s next! Some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wanna support some way to get builders paid with Nouns. Maybe can be done without new issuance by simply running a prop to fund an autobidder contract.</li>
<li>Would love to see something around a dynamic voting period, where the larger the funding request, the longer the voting time. (I see you already have this in your idea list)</li>

</blockquote>
<p>We’re currently getting inputs from the foundation lawyers regarding risks involved with the different ragequit design options we outlined in the document shared above.<br/>
Following that, we plan to bring the different design options to a more public debate, potentially with some token weighted voting to understand which version of ragequit the DAO is in favor of implementing.<br/>
Next after that would be implementation, audit &amp; on-chain prop.</p>
<p>Hard to give a timeline right now. This can be a very big change to the DAO so we are being careful with decision making here.</p>

<p>Another potential idea for the backlog:</p>
<p>When creating a proposal, allow to optionally set a longer voting dela and/or voting period.<br/>
The rational is to already put a proposal on chain, but not force a decision to made very quickly. Give room for discussion.</p>

</ul>
<p>I won’t go deep into it here, and I’m not involved with the end product (happy to make the connection), but I believe learning from their research, or making use of the Inverter Network would unlock better accountability for proposals as well as more collaboration potential within all Nouns forks and other DAOs in the broader Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
