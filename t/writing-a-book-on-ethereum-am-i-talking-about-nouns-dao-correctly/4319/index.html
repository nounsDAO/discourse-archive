<p>Hi:</p>
<p>I’m Paul Brody and I’m writing a book on Ethereum that will be published in July of this coming year.  For my day job, I’m the Global Blockchain Leader at EY (Ernst &amp; Young), but the book is a personal project that isn’t officially an EY publication.  The book is called “Ethereum for Business” and contains a brief case study about Nouns DAO in one of the chapters.   I’m attaching the text of the case study below and I would just ask that you take a quick look and verify that I have not made any inaccurate statements.  If you could reply no later than 20 April 2023, that would be appreciated.  I’ll assume if I don’t receive any reply that there’s no objections or errors here.  The case study written below is done entirely using publicly available information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Case Example: Nouns DAO</strong>:  Compared to many other very complex DAO organizations, Nouns DAO is simpler and clearer to understand: it’s at heart, an art project.  Each Noun is 32x32 pixel image that is generated based on a set of rules based on people, places, or things.  Each one is an NFT and a new one is made and auctioned off every day.  The proceeds go into the Nouns treasury and each noun-owning member can vote on proposals.</p>
<p>Nouns DAO has taken advantage of the mania for art NFT collectibles.  Typical nouns sell for between 20 and 100 Eth, basically starting at $35,000 and going up.  That’s a lot of money for a 32x32 pixel picture.</p>
<p>The Nouns treasury, as of January 2023 had accumulated nearly 28,000 Eth worth close to $50 million.  Proposals on how to spend the money are put up for a vote.  The community has funded all kinds of projects from a custom whisky venture to an AI team to design automated content generation tools that work with the Noun images.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll monitor the replies to this posting to check on things.</p>

<p>Hi! I am not sure i would say that Nouns DAO has “taken advantage of the mainia for art NFT collectables”.  Though, that may have happened by circumstance.</p>
<p>I would strongly recommend that you hop on to the Noun O’Clock twitter space a few times to learn a bit more.  It is a daily show with open mic so you can ask away!</p>
