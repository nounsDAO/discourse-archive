<p>Hello NounsDAO</p>
<p>As the month of March comes to an end so does the 30 day trail of the Sounds of Nouns Series. We laughed, we cried, but mostly I hope we all danced to the jingles, maybe while still crying?</p>
<p>The series is slowly gaining some traction on social media, has already sparked some collaboration in the Nouns discord and appears to be widely well received.<br/>
I propose a renewal of the series for another 30 days at the same rate to continue the proliferation of this project and enrich the Nouns universe.<br/>
For this round I was also wondering if the DAO wanted to revisit and explore the idea of scaling the project in a way possibly integrating the jingles more into the front end?</p>
<p>I can’t thank the NounsDAO and the community at large enough for their support for the project. It’s been a fun creative challenge and a real joy adding even more personality and dimension to the daily nouns. Here is a <a href="/t/small-grants-the-sounds-of-nouns-series-an-original-jingle-every-day-for-your-noun/719">LINK</a> to the original proposal and thanks for reading!</p>
<p>Best,<br/>
Nate The Sounds of Nouns Guy</p>
