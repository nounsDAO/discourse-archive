<p><em>[Revised Proposal]</em></p>
<p>(<em>TLDR, NFT Seattle is the first large scale Web3 event in the entire Pacific Northwest. We think it would be pretty sweet if the Nouns came in as title sponsors of this inaugural event</em>)</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#description-1" name="description-1"></a><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Becoming the Nounding Partners / Presenting Sponsors of NFT Seattle creates an opportunity for the Nouns to build relationships with the Pacific Northwest’s Web3 community and solidify the Noun meme in the foundation of these new relationships.</li>
<li>As we establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation, we’d love for the Nouns to come in at the ground level and cement the meme as an integral part of Seattle’s Web3 ecosystem, positioned for maximum and lasting brand exposure. The Web3 community is still growing in Seattle so the probability of reaching new people (vs people that already know about the Nouns) is likely higher here, than most other major US cities. Plus Seattle’s technically inclined demographic lends itself well to everything the Nouns stand for, though people here are still warming up to the whole idea of NFT’s.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#what-is-nft-seattle-2" name="what-is-nft-seattle-2"></a><strong>WHAT IS NFT SEATTLE</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>NFT Seattle is the first event catering to the broader Web3 community in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, BC).</li>
<li>The vision behind NFT Seattle is to establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation &amp; connect the growing community in the Northwest. We want to unite people in Seattle to educate &amp; expose them to the opportunities &amp; possibilities that Web3 brings to creators, businesses, artists, and communities.</li>
<li>This event is mainly targeting the Web3 curious and as such, has a heavier leaning towards education.</li>
<li>NFT Seattle will take place from 9/30/2022 - 10/1/2022 in Seattle at several venues including Block 41 and the Seattle NFT Museum (the worlds first NFT Museum).</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-should-nouns-be-involved-why-it-matters-3" name="why-should-nouns-be-involved-why-it-matters-3"></a><strong>WHY SHOULD NOUNS BE INVOLVED &amp; WHY IT MATTERS?</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>NFT Seattle presents a unique opportunity for the Nouns to proliferate the Nouns meme and imagery (think, Noggles in downtown Seattle) across a region that is still trying to figure out Web3 but is on the cusp of a major Web3 breakout. A region that has already cemented itself as a global hub for technological and cultural innovation, with everything from Amazon/Microsoft to Starbucks and many more having been birthed here.</li>
<li>As the first Web3 event in the Pacific Northwest, NFT Seattle will draw people in from Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC and will lean heavily towards education plus fostering deep, meaningful connection between brands, thought leaders and other attendees. Early data suggests the audience will be a healthy mix between the Web3 curious, and those that are pioneering in the space.</li>
<li>This event also creates a perfect opportunity for an IRL Noun meetup, for Nouns that are local to the region to come and engage with the local community while providing <em>Nouns on the Ground</em> an opportunity to execute their existing IRL events strategy, in a new untapped market. Also, hoping to partner with the Nounish marketing team to up-level the Nounishness of this activation if the prop passes. (Initial conversations have been started).</li>
</ul>

<a class="anchor" href="#the-breakdown-4" name="the-breakdown-4"></a><strong>THE BREAKDOWN</strong>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Presenting Title Sponsor of NFT Seattle</strong> (”NFT Seattle presented by the Nouns”). Nouns branding will be prominently featured at the Event and the official After Party.</li>

<strong>Live Art Premier</strong> that is nouns-inspired and incorporates the noggles, showcased by local high profile NFT artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jastidesigns/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Jaiden ‘Jasti’ Stipp,</a>, the 16yr old that made over a million selling NFT’s.</li>
<li>As a way of thanking the Nouns for being a founding event partner for NFT Seattle, this commemorative art-piece will become a permanent fixture at every NFT Seattle annual event, an exclusive benefit only being extended to the Nouns. We’ll store this piece for future use, or the Nouns can opt to claim it for use at other IRL events.</li>
<li>
<strong>Evergreen Video Content</strong> to drive meme awareness and exposure: 2 daily sizzle Reels to be shared upon completion of each event day specifically highlighting the Nouns, and 1 sizzle Reel showcasing the creation of the custom mural. Video content to be produced by local media partner Brandtegic.</li>
<li>
<strong>Nouns Branding exclusively featured on each String Backpack</strong> provided to all attendees upon entry. Nouns stickers and swag will also be included in each swag bag (we’d need help designing the stickers).</li>

<p><strong>Fireside chat with a Noun</strong>, an optional speaking opportunity where a designated Noun can share a bit about how the Nouns continue to play a key role in the advancement of the overall DAO ecosystem via the prop house model or a deep dive into cc0 NFT’s, using Nouns as a use-case.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#the-ask-5" name="the-ask-5"></a><strong>THE ASK</strong>

<li>10 ETH - Towards venue costs + event production team (labor)</li>
<li>16 ETH - Towards A/V production + other venue related expenses</li>

<p>This seems like a no-brainer to me. There are thousands of potential Nouners in Seattle and you only need to reach 1 of them to pay for this proposal twice over. I know there are some sticker manufacturers in the community already who can help you with that as well. I’m sure some of the fork projects would be interested in supplying you as well.</p>
<p>The only concern I have is that your time is very short, so get moving. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/></p>
