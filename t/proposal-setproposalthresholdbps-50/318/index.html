<p>This is a bit last minute but interested if anyone thinks this is terribly reasoned &amp; feels strongly it should not go on chain:</p>
<p>As the Noun supply grows, a static ProposalThreshold barrier disproportionately pushes proposal rights to fewer, larger wallets. As of this post’s date <strong>only 29 wallets hold &gt;1 Noun</strong>. The ‘delegate’ function allows for proposing collaboratively, however, due to the value and <strong>indivisibility</strong> of Nouns, this requires concentrated conviction among a small group of members, versus the scenario of accruing support via a small delegation from a larger number of participants (Compound DAO etc).</p>
<p>Generally, more potentially unique “Proposers” <strong>seems intuitively beneficial for decentralization</strong> and some DAOs support proposal rights for &gt;1k wallets with limited issues. <strong>There are ways to curb frivolous or malicious proposals</strong> (such as assigning a fee if a proposal fails) that have been used by other DAOs, and of course, the threshold can always be reverted if there is consensus on any negative consequences.</p>
<p>A conservative reduction of the required BPS to 50 (&gt;=1 Noun for 1st 200 days) may be desirable on balance?</p>
<p>as a personal note, campaigning on ballots always seemed strange to me.  tempted to write the on-chain proposal simply as:<br/>
“bc decentralization.”<br/>
… or maybe just the function call w no txt  <img alt=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/man_shrugging.png?v=10" title=":man_shrugging:"/></p>
