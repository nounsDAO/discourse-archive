<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>
<p>We took the concept of Twitter threads, reimagined it through the lens of Nouns, and created the idea of a web3 community internet thread where anyone can write their thoughts, articles, ideas, analyses, predictions, or literally anything on, and anyone can read it for as long as Ethereum is operational.</p>
<p>90% of the funds generated will go into the Nouns treasury pool, enabling us to repay the initial investment and contribute to the growth of the Nouns ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>If <em>Twitter</em> were to close tomorrow, where would your content created over the years go?<br/>
And if it were to happen to <em>Quora, Medium</em>, and similar sites?<br/>
The problem with every centralized site is that if it fails, your content disappears with it. This is what happened with MySpace, Friendster, Bebo, and thousands of other less well-known sites.<br/>
Another problem (which can be debatable) is the amount of content present on the internet for each specific topic, due to the ease of creation and distribution of such content.</p>
<p>These problems require an innovative, decentralized, and community-based solution.<br/>
So why not create a sort of decentralized book created by the community in the form of NFT paragraphs?<br/>
This is where the idea of the Nouns Thread was born. A platform where you can upload your articles, song lyrics, ideas, analyses, predictions, or anything else that comes to your mind (in textual form).<br/>
These paragraphs will have a character limit and will be written on-chain so that they can be read for as long as Ethereum is operational.<br/>
The minting cost will include the GAS fee for the on-chain minting of the paragraph + 0.02 ETH fee.</p>
<p><strong>Why Nouns?</strong></p>
<p>Nouns is the most innovative project in the web3 landscape.<br/>
The membership distribution system, the community treasury management, noggles, the mission, and the effort that the community is demonstrating to support noble causes are just a few of the reasons why I fell in love with Nouns.<br/>
In fact, I, along with five others, am working on a project based on the key concepts of the Nouns DAO for a decentralized startup studio called Founderz DAO.<br/>
And it is with the Founderz DAO that we are applying for this Hack Week.<br/>
It is important to note that Founderz DAO, as stated in the proposal, will receive 10% of the 0.02 ETH fee.</p>
<p><strong>Who is behind the Founderz DAO?</strong></p>

<p>These are some topics we would love to have your input on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you like another name instead? ( ‘Nouns Thread’ atm )</li>
<li>Should we give a % to a charity fund as well?</li>
<li>What improvements would you like to see on the design?</li>
<li>Wouldn’t it be cool to have ⌐◨-◨ or  a random derivative Nouns image linked to the paragraph itself? It could be engraved on the back side of the paragraph NFT.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we are working on the paragraph creation mockup and nouns thread navigator as well.<br/>
We’ll keep you updated in the next few days.</p>
<p><em>Stay Nounish</em>.</p>
