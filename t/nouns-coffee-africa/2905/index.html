<p>Africa is known for its rich history, biodiversity, and culture, but for coffee lovers, the continent is also known for producing some of the best coffee beans in the world, with its world-renowned quality and unique flavors. With that being said I’m proposing to the Dao to continue its Nouns Coffee journey on a new continent with endless opportunities to spread Nouns across Africa over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>Nouns Coffee has proven to be a winning formula and the original team has created the blueprint to start new versions of the brand across the world. Nouns Coffee Africa offices will be situated in Cape Town, South Africa where the product development and sourcing will begin &amp; bring the brand into fruition over a span of 3 to 6 months.</p>
<p>An African brand identity will be created to separate it from the original Nouns Coffee project, an e-commerce distribution hub will be created for the African continent that can easily branch into individual countries within Africa when the opportunity presents itself. The first pop-up coffee shop will be in Cape Town.</p>
<p>Nouns Coffee was built with 105 Eth and this covered all aspects of creating the infrastructure. We propose that the same amount is used to start the process in South Africa as this blueprint &amp; budget have been proven to be successful.</p>
<p>We have identified that the Nouns artwork can be used to represent 13 pillars within the coffee category, this is open for discussion, here are the coffee types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat White</li>
<li>Espresso</li>
<li>Lungo</li>
<li>Americano</li>
<li>Irish Coffee</li>
<li>Chocolate Coffee</li>
<li>Bat Coffee</li>
<li>Peanut Coffee</li>
<li>Bomb Coffee</li>
<li>Chilli Coffee</li>
<li>Canna Coffee</li>
<li>Monkey Coffee</li>
<li>Cherry Coffee</li>
<li>Cake Coffee</li>
<li>Beer Coffee</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal over a span of 2 years will be to create limited editions of blends that can be represented by these Nouns. You can look at this part of the project as creating a Nouns Coffee Africa menu &amp; collection. This will be an exciting journey for everyone in the Nouns community and the original creators of Nouns Coffee if they choose to, can expand with us into new blends. It is cool that all these Nouns can be used within a consumables project.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to discussing this proposal with all of you, let’s make Nouns Coffee Africa a reality.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p>
