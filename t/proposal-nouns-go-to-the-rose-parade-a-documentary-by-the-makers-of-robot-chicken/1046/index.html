<p>Nouns,</p>
<p>We are putting together a proposal for a comedic documentary film about the groundbreaking nature of the Nouns DAO and the web3 community and our weird journey of getting the Nouns featured in the Rose Parade. The Noun community has shown itself to be forward thinking, enterprising, generous, warm, funny and bold. Everything from donating to the Ukraine and making eye glasses for the underprivileged to being featured in a SuperBowl ad and funding the construction of a skatepark.</p>
<p>Before we officially submit our proposal we wanted to get your feedback here on the Discourse.</p>
<p>This documentary will be unique for three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stoopid Buddy has spent years developing a very specific comedic tone we want to bring to this documentary. The doc will tell the story of the Noun community and all the amazing initiatives it supports, but will be anchored with a strong narrative - the journey of getting the Nouns into the Rose Parade as the first ever NFT featured. This narrative lends itself to keeping things fun, silly and strange.</li>
<li>As part of the documentary story, we’ll be building and featuring six life size Nouns that will spread the Noun ethos through activities the Nouns community will have a say in driving. Do we want them handing out glasses? Giving random hugs to people in Time’s Square? Running in a half marathon? We’ll have fun and create great content for the documentary, all while showing just how the DAO works.</li>
<li>Our story will revolve around the journey to get a giant, vibrant Noun float in the Pasadena Rose Parade in 2023. The film will reach a climactic end with the six life size Nouns partying their way down the Rose Parade with a massive Noun float in tow!</li>
</ol>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We are inspired by this community and think the world needs to know how amazing and revolutionary this DAO is. We also think this is a great way to get this organization and brand out to a much wider audience. The Rose Parade will create tens of millions of impressions but the documentary will give this story life and legs and tee up the Nouns to further their reach into mainstream pop culture.</p>
<p>Who are we?<br/>
We are <a href="https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Stoopid Buddy Stoodios</a>. Most of you might know us from our flagship series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuWZzOusVJ8" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Robot Chicken</a>, but we’re also the studio behind Marvel’s MODOK, Crossing Swords on Hulu, and all the costumes on FOX’s <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/the_masked_singer-characters-publicity-split-h_2019.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Masked Singer</a>. And the studio that built a 15 foot walk around for <a href="https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/news/buddy-builds-at-pax-east/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">League of Legends</a>. We’ve been nominated for over 22 <a href="https://www.emmys.com/shows/robot-chicken" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Emmy’s</a> and won six of them. We’ve also won Cleo Awards for our advertising work and have worked with brands from DC, Marvel, Walking Dead, Star Wars, LEGO, Target, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBLThhKIoFM" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Denny’s</a> among many others. All that is to say we know how to translate the spirit of a brand into entertainment. We’re also the studio that last year built a life size walk around Noun that made an appearance at NFT.NYC. While our ambition for the next round of life size Nouns is even greater, this experience was amazing, and a source of inspiration for what’s to come.</p>
<p>But we don’t want to do this alone. We want to bring the entire Noun community together to help tell this story. We’ve already shared this idea with a few Nounders who will be supporting us, so we’re excited to share our idea with the wider community and engage with you all. Noun holders will have the opportunity to participate by voting on which Nouns get built as life size costumes, where these life size “Nouns in the wild” go on their journey, and even participate by walking along with other Nouns in the actual Rose Parade. The documentary will feature interviews with Nounders and Noun holders alike, and highlight projects that have been successfully funded and what type of impact they’ve made. This will be a movie making experience that engages the entire community.</p>

<p>This is going to be incredibly fun. Thank you <span class="mention">@townertime</span> and team for bringing it to us.</p>
<p>I wonder if it’s possible to release shorter videos at regular intervals as the feature length documentary is being made, and make these shorts part of the proposal? Feb. 2023 feels a long way off. In fact, the time between now and then is about the same amount of time that Nouns has been in existence.</p>
<p>The shorts could come in the form of informal “vlog” style updates, edited teasers, or other things you stumble upon along the way, with the idea that they build the momentum toward the feature length doc and bridge the attention gap while we wait.</p>

<p>There are definitely some fun BTS things we can do, and some great ideas for ancillary content once the walk around nouns are built.  We’d love to see other proposals jump off from there as well to utilize our walk arounds in the real world.</p>
<p>Keep the ideas coming Nouns!</p>

<p>Since you guys all know are regulars at DCON I would love to coordinate an activation at our booth with one or more of the walk around suits. DCON is late november and I know that a lot of your builders, animators either go to visit or exhibit so the whole thing would be a perfect storm of engagement. My pal Adrienne runs a big stage with live art and DJs and we have some solid ideas that would be pretty amazing to share and jam on. Her prop is here as well<br/>
Having built and performed in many suits in my past life I can say that this project is incredible and undervalued by about 2X at least .</p>
