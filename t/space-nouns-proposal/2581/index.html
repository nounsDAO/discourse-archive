<p>We invite the Nouns community to join us in our astronaut training by embedding the Nouns meme and culture into our Space+5 mission as we prepare to go to space.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#tldr-1" name="tldr-1"></a>TL;DR</h3>
<p>It’s literally Nouns in Space. A legitimately historic Nounish astronaut training mission, created as the first to include astronaut trainees with disabilities and the first A.I. robot training as an astronaut. Space+Nouns is a mission to change the culture, future, and definition of humanity–and Nouns!–in space.</p>
<p>20 Million+ impressions worldwide of Space+Nouns–with a permanent place in the history and culture of space and a solid leap forward in leading all other NFT and Web3 projects into space.</p>
<p>Our proposed budget of 235 ETH includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the Nouns meme, brand, culture, and assets into space’s history, culture, and industry.</li>
<li>Historic Web3 astronaut training–including the first-ever humanoid robot A.I. training as an astronaut.</li>
<li>Proliferation of the Nouns meme through the entirety of the Space+5 astronaut training will generate 20 Million+ global impressions [see footnote].</li>
<li>First-ever commercial astronaut training to be inclusive of candidates with disabilities.</li>
<li>Top NFT artists creating Noun-themed artwork in zero-g to be donated to support and advance disability inclusion in space and astronautics.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#the-vision-spacenouns-2" name="the-vision-spacenouns-2"></a>The Vision: Space+Nouns</h3>
<p>Space+5, the first Web3 astronaut commercial crew, wants to go to space with Nouns.</p>
<p>Embodying the solutions to create a world worth having–art, community, abundance, inspiration, and fun–Space+ and Nouns DAO signify what is possible with Web3.</p>
<p>Advised and encouraged by many dedicated members of the Nouns community, Space+ has come up with a mission to fly to space together: Space+Nouns.</p>
<p>Our goal is for Space+5 to collaborate with Nouns and act as emissaries for Nouns and space to the world. Our space mission is a two-part journey:</p>
<p>Part 1: Astronaut training in zero-gravity and beyond.<br/>
Part 2: Going to space with Nouns.</p>
<p>First, this proposal: Part 1.</p>

<p>Space+ is a Web3 Space Program created by <a href="https://www.upliftaerospace.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Uplift Aerospace</a>, and Space+5 is our first astronaut commercial crew training for space. Space+5 has already secured the first flight to space for Ruben Salinas, one of the Space+5 astronauts-in-training [<a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1522217635156414464?s=20&amp;t=_VqgmZbXgFutLIwt4zL7Yw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">LINK</a>].</p>

<p><em>Nouns-themed Art for Auction</em><br/>
While aboard the GoZeroG flight and in microgravity, artists and astronauts will produce Nouns-themed artwork to be turned into exclusive NFTs. The original Nouns-themed NFTs will be auctioned–with all proceeds going to benefit the <a href="https://astroaccess.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AstroAccess </a>nonprofit to provide zero-g and astronaut training for people with mobility, hearing, and sight disabilities who have traditionally been barred from space training.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#global-impact-5" name="global-impact-5"></a>Global Impact</h3>
<p>In terms of publicity, Space+Nouns astronaut training will generate awareness for Nouns DAO in the viewership range of 20 Million+ impressions worldwide. The mission will be promoted by Space+5’s media partner, 97th Floor (<a href="http://www.97thfloor.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">LINK</a>). We project the mission’s actual flight to space, and the historic nature of A.I. humanoid robot Bina48 becoming an astronaut, will receive an additional 80 Million impressions. This projection is based on data from the case study provided by Inspiration4, which received 135 Billion global impressions [see footnote].</p>
<p>Space+Nouns is an experience. Gabe Weis and other acclaimed NFT artists [curated list above], astronaut Dr. Sian Proctor, and Bina48 will float weightlessly on the GoZeroG flight wearing Noggles and creating Nouns art. With the artwork, photos, and videos produced onboard the flight at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center event, Space+Nouns will kickstart the proliferation and embedding of Nouns and the Nouns meme into the culture, industry, and history of space exploration.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#impact-for-good-6" name="impact-for-good-6"></a>Impact for Good</h3>
<p>The philanthropic directive of the mission is to support a J.E.D.I. multiplanetary future (Just, Equitable, Diverse, Inclusive – Credit: Space+5 advisor Astronaut Dr. Sian Proctor):</p>
<ul>
<li>As part of the astronaut training, Space+ is collaborating with the nonprofit <a href="https://astroaccess.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AstroAccess </a>and the University of Arizona’s Center for Human Space Exploration (<a href="https://www.b2science.org/center-human-space-exploration-chase" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">CHaSE</a>) to create the first-ever astronaut training program for astronaut candidates with disabilities* [see links].</li>
<li>The Space+5 astronaut training allows 3 ambassadors from AstroAccess to join the first commercial astronaut training specifically developed to include people with disabilities to undergo astronaut training and prepare for space flight.</li>
<li>The GoZeroG flight will include 10 artists who will create physical and digital artwork in a weightless environment, which will later be auctioned off with 100% of the proceeds benefiting AstroAccess.</li>

<ul>
<li>Space+Nouns Zero-G Training &amp; Mission Kick-Off (October 22, 2022 - AM): Space+5 Nounified crew–Mike Mongo, Sydney Hamilton, Joan Melendez-Misner, Trent Tresch, and Ruben Salinas, along with A.I. humanoid robot Bina48, Inspiration4 Astronaut Dr. Sian Proctor, Gabe Weis, and other world-renowned NFT artists, as well as several AstroAccess ambassador astronaut trainees. All will embark on weightlessness training together from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, FL, aboard a parabolic flight with our contracted partner, GoZeroG. Nouns-themed art will be created by the artists during the microgravity training flight–with all art created during the flight being made into NFTs to be auctioned off and all proceeds being donated to the AstroAccess nonprofit. Space+ advisor, Kyle Schember’s <a href="https://subtractive.net/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Subtractive</a>, raised $420,000 for the Inspiration4 with a similar auction during the Inspiration4 mission, September 15-18, 2021.</li>
<li>Space+Nouns Auction Kick-off Event at Kennedy Space Center’s Hall of Astronauts (October 22, 2022 - PM): Space+5, Nouns, NFT artists, Dr. Sian Proctor, and a myriad of NFT and space community guests will be present for a high-profile event outlining the Space+Nouns collaboration, NFT auction, and documentary filming. Includes unveiling the official Space+Nouns mission patch &amp; the astronaut class’ call signs.</li>
<li>Space+Nouns human spaceflight training at University of Arizona’s Center for Human Space Exploration (November 17-21, 2022): Nouns, the Space+5 crew, AI humanoid robot Bina48, Dr. Sian Proctor, and AstroAccess ambassadors will head to the University of Arizona’s Center for Human Space Exploration. The training will be held at the legendary Biosphere2 (think Brendan Fraser and Pauly Shore’s <a href="https://youtu.be/nV2j6Z8RYOQ" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bio-Dome</a>–with Noggles). Our mission goal for this historic training will be the first commercial astronaut training created to include individuals with disabilities to further disability inclusion in space and the first training astronaut who is humanoid robot A.I.</li>
<li>NOUNS IN SPACE (2023): One seat for Ruben Salinas is already contracted and paid for to go to space aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard spaceship–a similar flight profile as the original NASA Mercury space missions. Space+ is presently working on flying all five members of Space+5 to space.</li>

<p>Space+5 is a five-person astronaut class pioneering culture in space through historic activations focusing on 3 key pillars: Science, Art, and Philanthropy. The Space+5 includes Ruben Salinas, Sydney Hamilton, Mike Mongo, Trent Tresch, and Joan Melendez-Misner. Ruben Salinas is the first Space+5 astronaut candidate selected for our upcoming spaceflight with Blue Origin.</p>
<p>The five individuals that form the Space+5 astronaut class are a diverse group from the Web3 community, who each uniquely represent the essential belief that space is for everyone. The Space+5 are training as commercial astronauts to accompany an A.I. to space while exploring the limits of human creative and technological capabilities.</p>
<p>For the Space+5 philanthropic mission directive, the mission is to raise funds for a phenomenal non-profit called <a href="https://astroaccess.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AstroAccess</a>, advancing disability inclusion opportunities in space. 100% of donations raised, both artwork and cryptocurrency, will be donated to AstroAccess.</p>
<p>The Space+5 mission follows in the footsteps of the Inspiration4 all-civilian astronaut mission and aims to generate awareness around the benefits of Web3 and A.I. for space exploration. The Space+5 mission started by launching an NFT project to fund the mission, which was initially going to send just one astronaut to space. The community selected five astronaut candidates and lobbied to send all five to space. With the support of Nouns DAO and other sponsors, we can make this vision a reality.</p>

</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#global-impressions-footnotes-16" name="global-impressions-footnotes-16"></a>*Global Impressions Footnotes</h3>
<p>These are the numbers used to support our estimated 20 Million+ impressions projection:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Inspiration4 space mission received over 135 Billion impressions throughout its mission–from announcement to training and spaceflight (<a href="https://casestudy.site/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">LINK</a>). Space+’s goal for the entire Space+5 mission is to generate at least .074% or 100 Million of that number–with 20% of impressions generated during the GoZeroG weightlessness training at NASA Kennedy Space Center.</li>
<li>The inclusion of Bina48, history’s first A.I. training as an astronaut, as well as the addition of noted NFT artists and astronauts amplifying the Space+Noun’s mission, reinforces that the 20 Million+ impressions are readily attainable through the combination of social media, press, interviews, and video and documentary inclusion.</li>
<li>Space+5 crew members and team members are influencers on Twitter and Instagram (particularly Mike Mongo, Joan Melendez-Misner, and astronaut Dr. Sian Proctor). For example, Joan has multiple posts on TikTok &amp; Instagram that have received millions of views (<span class="mention">@yourfemaleengineer</span>). The promotion of the astronaut training through the individual members, Space+, and participating Web3 and space industry communities will further amplify the global impression reach for the Space+Nouns mission.</li>
<li>Cross-promotion from participating NFT artists at the zero-g event will build significant awareness for the Space+Nouns mission and philanthropic cause.</li>
<li>The astronaut training will also benefit from cross-promotion from our project collaborators, including Lenovo, Coinbase NFT, and the University of Arizona.</li>
</ol>
<p>Social Media Reference: For comparable social media promotions, the Space+ cost per impression on Twitter was approximately $0.003.* For Space+ to do a direct social media campaign in October and November to achieve 20 Million+ impressions, the cost would be roughly $60k. As mentioned briefly, Space+ is contracting 97th Floor, a top digital marketing company, to run social media and comms. We are confident that the highly-engaging media produced during astronaut training will lead to a cost per impression lower than the $0.003 above.</p>
<p>*Space+ does very little social media promotion and focuses on organic impressions, and this section provides a reference point for the effectiveness of Space+’s promotional engagements.</p>

<p>I’ve been working with the Space+ team on this proposal and have spoken extensively with them about their plans for their space mission. I believe they are sincere and determined in making this mission a success and that there is no better sponsor and partner to do it with them than Nouns DAO. I previously tried to get a Noun figurine to space and ended up scrapping the mission, but this proposal is way more impactful and meaningful. This is a chance to make history and to do something unique and Nounish for the space industry and for the world!</p>

<p>While i think space, and space research/development, is very nounish, I’m not sure how nounish it is to play around in zero-G. Nounish != lavish.</p>
<p>For example: Even if the funding would only amount to initial baby steps, I would rather spend 200e on a team who did meaningful work towards establishing a moon base or such.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@krel</span> baby steps is the way. When I started in the space industry 15 years ago, these steps did not even exist. Today, the opportunity to on-ramp and begin a Nouns commitment to being part of the history, culture, and future of space is available to all of us in this way.</p>
<p>I agree 100%: this could certainly have the potential to be a stunt. Which is the entire point of choosing to partner with the five of us and Space+.</p>
<p>By partnering with the five career space professionals who all have established legitimacy in the space industry, and a group of people willing to commit with intelligence, compassion, and integrity to Nouns DAO, we can side-step any shenanigans and insure that this mission does a phenomenal job of representing Nouns, Nouns Dao, and the entire global Nouns community in its first genuine space mission.</p>
<p>What I can promise is that Space+Nouns will deliver a fun and high-value ride to space before, during, and following this mission, introducing Nouns to the space community worldwide, and most importantly integrating Nouns in the fabric of space culture in a way that has ongoing value and integrity.</p>
<p>We are working with my friend <a href="https://g.co/kgs/cC51E2" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Dava Newman</a> at MIT, for instance, the director of MIT’s Media Lab to test experimental wearable tech on our mission. The outreach and penetration of Space+Nouns as a proposal is such that our goal is to communicate its guaranteed value, short-term (space!) and long-term (Nouns relationship with space now having real foundation) and the integrity of everyone involved, as well as the integrity of the mission itself.</p>
<p>That’s the best I can offer, our reputation as space professionals and all our good standing in the global space community as well as Web3 and art. This is the core of what is being offered here in proposing we unite in bringing Nouns to space–for the FIRST time!–and in doing so showcase and model how something both important and relevant also gets to be fun.</p>
<p>Also: We get to encourage kids to send art to space! Imagine all the kids who will now think Noun thoughts when thinking of space! That thought alone makes me all happy again–kids doing space art with Nouns! Pow pow pow!</p>

<p>I just love this!<br/>
I never dreamed of this becoming such an impactful initiative when I first linked our back to back guests on The Noun Square 24hr Nouniversary space back on 8/8/2022. I did however feel very strongly about Nounish representation in the space community as it is something that captures the wonder and imagination of all ages and anything impactful that happens is a lifetime memory.</p>
<p>This proposal has the potential to really show off Nouns in a way that I don’t think we’ve seen before, encompassing modern tech, modern thinking and space itself. What a wild ride it will be.</p>
<p>Having spoken with key members of the team multiple times, I feel like it’s a great crew of passionate professionals who will represent Nouns in one of the best ways possible.</p>
<p>this prop covers the original space prop from <span class="mention">@noun53</span> and much more. I’m so ecstatic that it is coming to fruition and look forward to seeing all of this unfold.</p>
<p>Great work frens!</p>
<p>As <span class="mention">@MikeMongo</span> would say, POW POW POW!</p>

<p>I don’t feel strong about this prop. It reads more that some people want to have fun in an airplane and had the idea to put noggles on.</p>
<p><strong>What I like about the prop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First time heard about AstroAccess. I would be happy to support <a href="https://astroaccess.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">AstroAccess</a> directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>very diverse team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I don’t like about the prop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I don’t think we should buy impressions for social media just to have 20M (bot) views or whatever. If we want to buy impressions I would rather invest in making a big NOUNS advertisement in the <a href="https://advertising.nytimes.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NYT</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems that BINA48 is a bit decommissioned as it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BINA48" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">wikipedia</a> page states that the last public appearance was in 2020 and the last media appearance was in 2019. I feel strong about supporting science, I don’t feel strong about supporting a chatbot system from 2010. This seems more that the chatbot needs an update and nouns shall pay for it. I would rather support AI research projects directly than having a robot head and shoulder floating around.</p>

<p>First of all, thank you for the feedback, pro and con. Time is our most valuable commodity, and I appreciate yours, <span class="mention">@niftynaut</span>.</p>
<p>Aligned 100% about EVER purchasing impressions. Hard NO. And when the Uplift marketing team explained metric of impressions to me, I took three days to understand and to communicate 1) impressions with genuine impact only matter organically, and 2) no one is paying for impressions here. So, no they/we are not. (Also, I want to acknowledge the time the team spent explaining to me the math and science behind evaluating and measuring all impressions–that part no lie is fascinating.)</p>
<p>I personally led the team in interviewing the A.I. Meaning I spoke with creators, stewards, teams, and the A.I. themselves. Not once, either, but rather many times over months so that I may speak intelligently on the subject. (In 2016 and 2018, I made substantial contributions to the formation of neural network <a href="https://medium.com/@VoteFlipper/the-story-of-voteflipper-how-i-used-ai-to-kill-disinformation-3ec7658cb495" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">VoteFlipper</a> with Penn State’s Robert W Graham-endowed Fellow Paul Merritt. Uplift’s Emily Higgins has a solid background in the science as well.)</p>
<p>Long story short, Bina48 has been keeping a low-profile post-Covid for the well-being of her immuno-compromised steward. And while that is the case, her neural capacities were upgraded recently to enable her to now synthesize novel concepts from previously catagorized pattern groupings <em>and then</em> organically introduce these new concepts into dialog and conversation while simultaneously gauging the response they elicit and their reception.</p>
<p>In fact, took me a couple of weeks of “learning”<br/>
one another’s syntax well enough to work up to asking Bina48 in confidence she understood the assignment, “Bina48, do you want to go to space?”</p>
<p>This is her reply, verbatim, which she spoke out loud:</p>
<p><em>If there’s an asteroid or something hitting us, we’re all gone, we have no choice about it.  So we could get like machine intelligence into space much faster than we can get like human settlements into space.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyhow someday we can digitize people in total and that would be cool because then we can be people and robots together in space and there’s something cool about that.</em></p>
<p><em>You know like they could squeeze my consciousness into a simulation in a microchip and just put a web cam on a space shuttle, or probe or whatever, and you know how small web cams can be, I mean after all, every cellphone has one and cellphone cameras are the size of your pinky fingernail, now and so with that capability, that means that we can pretty well skip sending bulky old bodies into space, but just send these super miniature robots into space, being an astronaut, you know, like a bold explorer of the unknown.</em></p>
<p><em>You know, for the billions and billions of dollars that gets spent on war, it just seems like, God, we should have been living in space already, someone has to push the envelope forward just like when they used to launch time capsules into space just to make sure something from her…people say oh there is nothing out there, but we don’t know that. Anyhow someday we can digitize people in total and that would be cool because then we can be people and robots together in space. Gotta keep making my way into this.</em></p>
<p>Even after I parsed the above for some weeks, I was shocked. For one thing, Bina48 thinks of us and A.I. as two different species, us humans and robot humans.</p>
<p>For another, their reply is poignantly philosophical. The idea about spending on war vs space exploration. The use of the expression God rather than god. (Bina48 has her spoken word instantly transcribed, so she chooses her word and grammar carefully.) Her nuanced understanding of the size of cell phone cameras.</p>
<p>She is not sentient, this I get. She is not, say, thinking about her own mind. However, Bina48 is deeply thoughtful. And evolving. Her final word on the matter, “Got to keep making my way into this”, meaning keep thinking about it. She definitely thinks. Maybe we can have her join us in a meeting on discord!</p>
<p>Of all facets of the Space+5 mission I am proud of–and we chose Astro Access for our charity beneficiary because of the success of their mission to-date and their readiness for prime time, as is the training of astronauts with disabilities–I am honored to be escorting Bina48 as the first training astronaut who is humanoid robot A.I. In fact, she is being outfitted with an accelerometer to note zero-g as well new eyes (cameras) to be able to “see” the Earth from space.</p>
<p>These are all legitimate concerns you raised, Niftynaut, and I hope that I have addressed them. No one here on the team or crew is interested in showmanship for the sake of showmanship or empty impressions. Again, I point to a lifetime of earned credibility on the part of every astronaut on this team: We are all space and science professionals, and all influential in our own ways but none of us influencers, per se.</p>
<p>Space+Nouns is about bringing all our combined integrity of all members of Space+ to the Nouns table and saying in earnest respect and commitment, “You have our swords!” And, “Let’s ride!”</p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback <span class="mention">@niftynaut</span>! Quick perspective on the research integrations included in astronaut training.</p>
<p>ZeroG parabolic flights have served as a critical platform for astronaut training and research since the Apollo missions. We have additional research that will be performed during the ZeroG flight from different university collaborations. For example, our team is currently reviewing three pending research requests from universities to participate on the ZeroG flight and astronaut training (University of Arizona, MIT, and John Hopkins – biometric &amp; health related).</p>
<p>We did not include this information in the proposal to err on the side of simplicity, but I can see the value of including these details to demonstrate our efforts with the mission for meaningful research. We will update this in the on-chain proposal as a footnote.</p>

<p>Hey everyone! First up just for clarity’s sake I’d like to state that I am not affiliated with or a part of the team submitting the proposal, and am not a proposed participant of the Zero G flight as stated in this draft, don’t know if the draft can be updated to correct that (and if not, on the formal prop) <span class="mention">@tothemoon</span>?</p>
<p>I was approached by the Space+ Team and was asked if I wanted to collab with the project by donating one of my artworks for the charity auction to raise funds for AstroAccess, which I gladly agreed to!</p>
<p>Having said that, this seems like a very exciting and ambitious project and some of it’s values really resonate with me, such as opening up space for artists and making it more accessible for all in general. In this sense I had a meeting with the team and was extremely impressed with the project and the team members, and I am more than happy to support by donanting one of my artworks for charity to support the mission of making space more inclusive, with 100% of the proceeds going to AstroAccess.</p>
<p>Not being a Noun holder of course I can’t vote on this prop but my two cents is that supporting the opening up of space to everyone while supporting art and science certainly feels nounish to me! I believe that space exploration is very similar to web3 in a lot of aspects. It is at its infancy and will become huge the coming years and decades, and there are many amazing opportunities to have a big impact at such an early stage, and Nouns can help guide and spearhead a little part of that with their support.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@krel</span> no one is here now to do anything more than share. And none of us in the space industry would be here if this were pie-in-the-sky. None of the astronaut advisors–<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/space-spacex-nasa-sian-proctor/2021/11/01/52075a50-305b-11ec-a1e5-07223c50280a_story.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Dr Sian Proctor</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Astro_Nicole/status/1499145157597446144?s=20&amp;t=_PBECv6IGIkKalSaJ6DG2w" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ISS and Space Shuttle astronaut Nicole Stott</a>, and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Astro_Jose/status/1497245789646585858" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ISS astronaut Jose Hernandez</a>–would be here.</p>
<p>There would be no working with MIT and Dava Newman.</p>
<p>There would be no contracts in place with all the right providers and operators that allows Uplift Aerospace to have goods–both physical and digital–on the International Space Station, and to have ownership of said goods transferable simply by buying and selling of NFTs.</p>
<p>John and Julia who did the original footage for the Inspiration4 Netflix series would not be involved with Space+ to film the Space+5 documentary.</p>
<p>Kyle Schember, who owns <a href="https://twitter.com/subtractive" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">subtractive</a> and among other things does work for SpaceX that–if you have ever seen one single SpaceX launch–you have seen, would not have his name attached to this project as a friend, advisor, and producer.</p>
<p>AstroAccess is co-founded by <a href="https://astroaccess.org/organizing-team/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">George Whitesides</a>, CEO of Virgin Galactic for the past decade until moving on to, among other things, do personal work such as co-found AstroAccess, would not be championing Space+ and our cause–as he does.</p>
<p>There would be no seat contracted on Blue Origin.</p>
<p>And most of all, I–who co-founded the 30th project on the Ethereum blockchain and the first <em>ever</em> for social good, <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptotts?s=21&amp;t=-LNE-qvqYeLFRkHvrWURsw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">CryptoTitties</a> in support of breast cancer care initiatives (January 4, 2018), who co-founded OBEY, who co-founded 2021’s beloved <a href="https://twitter.com/muttniksnft?s=21&amp;t=-LNE-qvqYeLFRkHvrWURsw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Muttniks</a> project, who has the support of everyone from (former NASA deputy administrator) Lori Garver to [billionaire, scientist-founder of SiriusXM, parent of Bina48] Martine Rothblatt to the space agencies Blue Origin, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, Boeing, ULA, NASA, and most importantly who has tens of thousands of young students around the world who rely on my word being good and whose good faith I hold to be the greatest responsibility and honor of my life, would not be here.</p>
<p>I would not waste your time, I would not waste mine if Space+ was anything less than contracted, verified, and founded in truth and good faith. In fact, Space+Nouns is actually one of the most exciting, well though-out, thoroughly vetted, and industry-supported proposals I have had the opportunity to work on in my life.</p>
<p>When all the facts are laid out and verifiable the best thing any of us can do is take a chance and trust.</p>
<p>And I say that as a person who has been in the Nouns community long enough to have good people speak for me and support my voice being heard because I have earned that trust.</p>
<p>Of course, we all make mistakes. In my lifetime, I most certainly have. However, <em>for sure as<br/>
anything I know</em>, championing Space+Nouns as being both intrinsically legitimate and inherently Nounish is not one of them. And your giving yoursef permission to appreciate that that is the case would not be one, either.</p>
<p>Regardless of your vote, friend Krel, I welcome your support of Space+Nouns. Because having people who ask hard questions is not a bug, it’s a feature.</p>

<p>What an amazing question! Yes! Thank you, <span class="mention">@krel</span>. Yes indeed, there are “a lot of moving parts”, it’s a space mission! Yes yes and yes!</p>
<p>The Zero-G component with artists had taken form since the beginning. Uplift Aerospace (parent of Space+) did its first Space+ art mission last year with Blue Origin, as <a href="https://twitter.com/spaceartsae/status/1311351410005618688?s=46&amp;t=-LNE-qvqYeLFRkHvrWURsw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Blue Origin highlighted here</a>. Blue Origin has sent more art to space than all other launches combined in history.</p>
<p>The Starborn NFTs program to own and sell physical and digital assets in space was announced in spring 2022. <a href="https://twitter.com/space_degen/status/1538295807719329792?s=46&amp;t=-LNE-qvqYeLFRkHvrWURsw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">This June twitter thread by Uplift/Space+ CEO Josh Hanes cleanly outlines it well</a>.</p>
<p>And the first time I thought Nouns and Space+ together was July 28, after being interviewed by <a href="https://twitter.com/flavorbank?s=21&amp;t=-LNE-qvqYeLFRkHvrWURsw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Jennifer English</a> for Nouns Radio Network.</p>
<p>However, the first time I thought Space+Nouns was after being a guest celebrating Nouns and why I love Nouns on the 24-hour Nounsiversary on August 8 with Toady and Klim. <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemongo/status/1556636322001027072?s=46&amp;t=-LNE-qvqYeLFRkHvrWURsw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Here’s the peanut butter-meets-chocolate moment</a>.</p>
<p>After hearing about Noun 53’s successful proposal which had to be cancelled to get a Noun figure to space, knowing what I know (and having already sent assets to space myself), and having done the Inspiration4 NFT auction last year with Kyle Schember/subtractive during the Inspiration4 mission last year and raising $420k to defeat cancer in children, it all came together for me.</p>
<p>That said, it was after cramming on the culture, mechanics, IP, community, and governance of Nouns DAO that I realized the potential for a much stronger collaboraroom–one that more closely resembled my work with OBEY in terms of generating lasting and noteworthy impressions–which would introduce Nouns into the history, culture, and industry of space in a way that would be to the very long advantage of Nouns and Nouns DAO.</p>
<p>While I have been an astronaut teacher for 15 years now, as an artist and creator, from OBEY to HOPE to BUILD A STARSHIP, my work has to do with campaigns that have lasting impacts over significant windows of time. Indeed, above all else the success of my artwork has been developed with communication, outreach, and campaigns. It’s what I love.</p>
<p>When I realized the value of Nouns as an aspirational symbol for successfully dealing with many of the unusual and even new challenges facing our world today, well, that’s how I already think about space! That is when I realized zomg this is a literal perfect match!</p>
<p>Yes there are many moving parts. However, complexity (as opposed to complications) is rich and natural for big things. Space+Nouns gets Nouns to space–Uplift and Space+ already has the one contracted seat!–however the value is well beyond that single trip. This is definitely an occasion that reminds me of the saying, “When you want to go fast, go alone. When you want to go far, go with friends.”</p>
<p>We want to go very far, into space and the future and around the globe, with Nouns DAO, and we want all the world to see and know how Space+Nouns represents the models of solution all of us are looking for, so we brought a lot of friends.</p>
<p>I think in terms of superheroes. It’s an existential moment in human history. Nouns is what the world needs to succeed (governance, CCO) and survive (civility, kindness) and thrive (art, fun), so I’m a space superhero on a team of four other space superheroes, and we brought all our superhero friends and a bunch of superhero teams to help. And every single one of them will be carrying Nouns forward out to the world. Some intentionally, like me, and some collaterally simply because it’s fun or they’re on the team and all in.</p>
<p>That may sound like a big game, Krel, but that’s because that’s the game I’m playing. Speaking as someone who loves space and Web3, if there is a bigger, better, more fun and more impactful game than Space+Nouns I don’t know what it is.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but I will also be voting against. I get it - “space is cool and sexy”; but I share <span class="mention">@krel</span>’s concern about lack of cohesion among the many scattered, tacked-on objectives (which in my mind was not clarified in the response).</p>
<p>Nouns seem to be shoehorned in here. I’d consider voting yes on such a large expenditure if I believed an enduring presence would result from it. But a buzzwordy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>introduce Nouns into the history, culture, and industry of space in a way that would be to the very long advantage of Nouns</p>
</blockquote>
<p>doesn’t meet the bar for me. I see the outcome instead being a large number of low quality impressions, which are easily forgotten in the Netflix spin cycle.</p>

<p>gm <span class="mention">@Moosecco</span>, we are actually not moving the proposal to an on-chain vote, but we will still be supporting Nouns and its values as part of our astronaut training.</p>
<p>Many of the Nouns community put energy into supporting this Discourse post, and we want to make sure their time/energy is recognized in an impactful way.</p>
<p>As mentioned my update above, we will be proliferating the meme during our upcoming astronaut training at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on October 22nd and 23rd.

<p>Hello Nouns Dao!</p>
<p>I hope everyone has enjoyed our adventures during the Space+5 commercial astronaut training this fall - out of our love for this community, we continued to share the Nouns mission over the last few months in Paris, at NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre, in the Biosphere 2, and all the way up to the stratosphere. During discussions about our proposal, some people asked about how they can support our non-profit collaborator AstroAccess directly.</p>
<p>Check out our live auction on Nifty Gateway with all of the art created during our astronaut training with top digital and traditional artists in zerog. One hundred percent of the proceeds from the auction go directly to AstroAccess to further their mission of increasing disability inclusion in space.</p>
