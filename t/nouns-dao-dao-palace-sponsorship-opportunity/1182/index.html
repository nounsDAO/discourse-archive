<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#proposal-summary-2" name="proposal-summary-2"></a>Proposal Summary</h2>
<p>$30,000 (~11 ETH) to support a DAO research-focused residency at a castle in Germany, called Schloss Bückeburg, hereafter referred to as the DAO Palace. We are hosting a 2-week residency for DAO builders, economists, researchers, founders, world leaders, and politicians.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#what-project-are-you-building-4" name="what-project-are-you-building-4"></a>What project are you building</h2>
<p>The DAO Palace is a two-week focused residency at a 700-year old palace in Germany, hosted by the aristocratic family living in it. 30 participants will be invited to build projects, develop theories, and standards aimed at supporting the development of resilient DAOs that can withstand economic, environmental, and regulatory forces. The 30 participants will be a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals actively engaged with DAOs.</p>
<p>One of the outcomes of the event will be to launch a DAO focused on regenerative use of traditional spaces, and bringing innovation and collaboration back to these historic venues, a People’s UNESCO. Members will have access to a global network providing co-living and co-working spaces within cultural heritage sites for Web 3.0 Incubation.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-did-you-decide-to-build-it-5" name="why-did-you-decide-to-build-it-5"></a>Why did you decide to build it</h2>
<p>DAOs are still struggling to create the user experience and new worker economy they have the potential to disrupt. User interfacing and Treasury Economics are often flawed and miss the objective of providing a stable ecosystem. Alongside this, Governance processes are yet to be perfected, often lacking proper member engagement to enact changes beneficial to participants. To make things worse, underlying security flaws and insecurities as to the regulatory environment and member liabilities create more concern for the potential of DAOs to create stable ecosystems. It is clear that DAOs are still in the experimentation phase, and need dedicated individuals to research in which use cases or formats DAOs are best applicable towards, how these should be structured, which standards they should adhere to, and how members can be protected and engaged to participate in an environment within which attention spans are often limited and tooling poorly designed.</p>
<p>The DAO Palace aims to bring together the brightest individuals contributing towards or researching the DAO space to produce standards, philosophies, research or products that tackle some of these mentioned underlying issues. It is hosted at the Bueckeburg Palace - a place within which participants can remain undistracted from outside forces and that has hosted several of the greatest historical thinkers throughout time. By bringing this philosophy into the 21st Century, the Bueckeburg Palace can once again become an Innovation hub for disruptors of the status quo.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#about-the-event-6" name="about-the-event-6"></a>About the event</h2>
<p>Participant Count</p>
<p>There will be 30+ active Participants including the core team committee members for a duration of 14 days (July 1st - 15th), each of these will be carefully selected to contribute to the extitutional framework by being active and engaged thinkers, builders, or entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Agenda</p>
<p>There is no clear cut agenda for topics to be worked on, as the team believes in the natural synergies that occur from a selection of top-level participants. Instead, there will be some room for group building activities towards the beginning, presentations to be held throughout the event, and an “Open House” Weekend between the 7th and 10th July to invite outsiders, VIP guests or Investors to visit the facilities and view our progress.</p>
<p>Visitors / VIPs</p>
<p>Some top level developers or guests from traditional industries and politics will be invited to visit the event in the hope that they can contribute with their own experiences and help building a bridge between the still seclusive Web3 and Traditional Worlds.</p>
<p>Location and Reasoning</p>
<p>The Bueckeburg Palace has served as the Home to the Princely family of Schaumburg-Lippe for over 700 Years and still is today. It has since served as the centrepoint to several historical figures including Napoleon Bonaparte, Mikhail Gorbachev, Immanuel Kant and artists such as Johann Sebastian Bach. By harnessing the philosophy of the palace being a centrepoint for great thinkers, alongside the unique experience of having access to facilities, it aims to bring the same opportunity to modern disruptors of industry and thought. The space of the facilities, and the potential use cases of Web3 products to support cultural institutions will thereby serve as inspiration for the participants as to how this industry can truly change the world.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#how-much-funding-are-you-requesting-7" name="how-much-funding-are-you-requesting-7"></a>How much funding are you requesting</h2>
<p>$30,000 (~11 ETH). This is intended to be part of a co-funding round supported by several key organizations across the DAO ecosystem. The funding will be used for preparing the venue for the residency, hosting the guests, and paying for event related expenses.</p>
<p>If we raise funding beyond the identified budget, leftover funds will go to the DAO treasury to be used for future events, operations, and projects.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-fund-this-8" name="why-fund-this-8"></a>Why fund this?</h2>
<p>In our experience having successfully organized residencies with similar formats in the past, events like this lead to immense amounts of collaboration, open source knowledge, and leaps forward in technical progress. Sponsors have a unique opportunity to be involved, fund positive-sum outcomes, and build a network with highly aligned builders and leaders in the space.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#why-nouns-dao-10" name="why-nouns-dao-10"></a>Why Nouns DAO?</h2>
<p>Nouns DAO is a very unique experiment in the DAO space and including a DAO like Nouns DAO into DAO Palace and the future DAO brings an important additional perspective to the community.</p>
<p>Up to now, Nouns DAO has done some interesting activities to grow awareness of Nouns including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the Apple Watch app (100 ETH)</li>
<li>Sending a Noun to space! (63 ETH)</li>
<li>Trading for an appearance in a Super Bowl commercial (1 Noun)</li>
</ul>
<p>These proposals tend to be focused on mostly mainstream audiences. And I just learned about <a href="https://muc.xyz/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://muc.xyz/</a> - awesome to see!<br/>
I am not familiar with any Nouns DAO initiatives that are more focused on the DAO ecosystem and working together with other DAOs to strengthen the platform and future for DAOs.</p>
<p>DAO Palace is this opportunity. This first of its kind event would be an environment that could allow Nouns to grow deeper into the ecosystem, while helping support the incubation of new DAO ideas to benefit all.</p>
<p>Additionally, participation by Nouns DAO in this high profile event would also bring further awareness to Nouns DAO, making it a win-win situation.</p>
<p>And all this lasting impact for only a fraction of what these other initiatives cost!</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#benefits-to-nouns-dao-11" name="benefits-to-nouns-dao-11"></a>Benefits to Nouns DAO?</h2>
<p>This DAO-focused high-profile event will likely receive media attention. Most of this will likely come following the event.</p>
<p>Separately, two DAO-focused documentary film crews have already expressed interest to cover pieces of the event.</p>
<p>There is also a plan to produce an array of content out of the event. This includes a continuous journal of what takes place, the ideas that come out of it, and also any research that is produced.</p>
<p>As there is a plan for FWC DAO to organize a number of innovation hubs going forward, Nouns DAO would likely have an opportunity to use the space for any Nouns DAO related events in the future.</p>
<p>One more key note would be that Nouns DAO would be participating in live research work around security of DAOs. Given its unique parameters of small supply of stakeholders growing slowly over time, perhaps the Nouns DAO system would be an ideal system to deeply analyze. Any research and outputs that come out of the event could also be shared as an interesting case study.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#risks-and-potential-delays-12" name="risks-and-potential-delays-12"></a>Risks and potential delays</h2>
<p>Supply chain</p>
<p>We are ordering supplies, network upgrades, and other necessities to put on this event. We are ordering supplies and reserving things far in advance to prevent disruptions and are implementing backup plans.</p>
<p>Health &amp; Safety</p>
<p>We are conscious of the risks of hosting IRL events during a time of uncertainty with the pandemic. We intend to take all necessary precautions to ensure residents, guests, and hosts are protected. If the event has to be canceled for health &amp; safety reasons we will work with sponsors to return unused funds or redirect them towards a rescheduled event.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#success-13" name="success-13"></a>Success</h2>
<p>We will measure the success of the project by the research outcomes, strong relationships, and future collaborations between the residents, the DAO space, and the sponsors.</p>

<p>Borrowing words from Teddy, co-organizer of DAO Palace:</p>
<p><em>"The role of Nobility or Aristocracy, is in this day and age meaningless - it does not hold any power, nor does it represent the views that we share. The Hereditary aspect applies only to the Stewardship of extremely expensive cultural heritage objects that are near impossible to maintain. Our title, therefore, is only a representation of our obligation towards these objects and our inherent responsibility towards them - it is now an antiquated role like “Lieutenant” or “CEO” - nothing more. This means that I do not have a choice in my life - I am obliged to maintain and curate a museum - I did not choose this role, but I carry it with dignity as far asI cab.</em></p>
<p><em>Our family, like many others of similar backgrounds in Germany, have changed their views entirely - we do not wish for monarchies to re-emerge, nor do we endorse any failures of past family members. We are all Democratic to the core and believe this in our very essence.</em></p>
<p><em>The issue was that Castles were historically Exclusive places - reserved for upper echelons of society, and open only to invitation by the “Ruling” members. My hope is that this changes - the same way access to resources is being democratised across the Web3 space, I was inspired to hopefully democratise access to cultural heritage sites, so that they can serve as spaces for people of diversity to unite and build a better future.</em></p>

<p><em>The team believes in this opportunity to re-define and disrupt another ancient legacy system for the better, and allow all people of all backgrounds to access the benefits of these monuments to both cherish their culture and make use of what they could offer in this modern context."</em></p>
<p>Compared to buying space in a very exclusive overpriced Super Bowl commercial, I see this as a fair, important opportunity for Nouns DAO to participate in and help form the future life of DAOs.</p>
