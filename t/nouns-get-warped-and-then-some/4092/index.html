<p>The Warped community includes millions of fans and thousands of participating artists, athletes, gamers, and cultural and philanthropic organizations.</p>
<p>J.D. plans to introduce several phased proposals for WarpedWorld, with a WarpedNouns sub-DAO leading to community proliferation and ecosystem growth.</p>

<p>J.D. will introduce his other existing web3 projects to the Nouns ecosystem as proposals, utilizing the Noun infrastructure to proliferate the Nouns meme and community while activating new audiences.</p>
<p>Example projects include collaborating with an acclaimed dance cinematographer and a top dance company to support pro and amateur dancers worldwide, as well as a concept celebrating music scholarship with top-tier artists. Both projects focus on generating Nounish benefits while fostering community.</p>

<p>As both an entrepreneur and EIR, J.D. will draw on his experience to bring additional projects and communities to the Nouns ecosystem. For example, inspired by the recent “Wizard’s Hat” short film and Wizard Nouns, J.D. has already introduced the concept of a potential Nouns collaboration with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Warner Bros., and the Potter fan community. At Warner Bros., J.D. worked extensively with Wizarding World.</p>

<p>J.D. will partner with established Nouns projects to generate synergies among UnitedTribes initiatives and assist Noun projects needing access to talent and organizations throughout his network.</p>
<p>As an illustration, the WarpedWorld project envisions a series of introductory IRL events in partnership with Vans, which may offer possibilities for presenting Gnars, That’s Gnarly, ComicsDAO, Nouns OTG, Nouns Esports, and other Nouns projects to the Warped community. The Nouns/WarpedWorld collaboration will unlock opportunities for Nouns’ involvement in both IRL and virtual Warped events.</p>

<p>Thanks Evil! I knew there was a chance someone might interpret my proposal as you have, so it’s important that I address your concerns:</p>
<p>I’ve been a builder my whole career. I’m proud that I’ve successfully worked precisely as I’m proposing to the Nouns community, and delivered tremendous value to other organizations in this way. I am committed to demonstrating a multiple on the investment through exposure, proliferation, and new Nounish executions. I aim to demonstrate to folks like you that I’ll work tirelessly to create value and be a great community member!</p>
<p>My objectives for this project are to introduce the Nouns to new communities, become an expert in working within the community and providing collaborative opportunities for community resources, and build sustainable businesses that leverage the Nouns’ tech stack…returning value to the DAO.</p>
<p>I am not just bringing my projects to the Nouns but also bringing the Nouns to CAA, one of the premier agencies in the talent business. This project alone will expose the Nouns community to all sorts of creators and, in turn, produce new opportunities for the Nouns. The Warped project will also provide exposure to a range of Noun builders, including opportunities to collaborate with NounsOTG, Gnars, ComicsDAO, Nouns Esports, and more.</p>
<p>I am also exploring a potential collaboration with my former colleagues at Warner Bros in the Wizarding World and Wizarding World fan community. Although these things may take time, I have already begun educating the people at Warner Bros about the Nouns and setting up plans to move forward. -If we can do it right with the Wizarding World…there’s much more to explore with Warners and the many creators across the studio.</p>
<p>…And we’ll go far beyond CAA and Warners to deep connections throughout my network.</p>
<p>While I do need to be compensated for my work, my motivation for doing this is not for the ETH. I believe that I can create value and demonstrate to the world that there’s something exceptional happening in the Nouniverse, and that it can be grown in new ways.</p>
<p>If you’d like to connect, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m happy to talk anytime, -J.D.</p>

<p>I view working with Nouns DAO as the next new, (hopefully!) better way to build. I don’t think it’ll all be easy, but I do believe that if we can get the playbook right… the sky’s the limit.</p>

<p>I remember the Warped Tours, was that your company?</p>
<p>We were considering it for Uglydoll in 2012 or so.</p>
<p>Brands could set up booths at these wild events and concerts… helped brands like So So Happy… I think thats how they got into Toys R us.</p>
<p>Have you transitioned to web 3 all in, or will these in person tours return?</p>

<p>Hey David! I’m so happy you commented as I’ve been meaning to reach out for some time.</p>
<p>I’d LOVE to talk to you directly about our WarpedWorld plans, the big picture is to reinvent across web3 in a way that allows members of WarpedWorld to move between IRL and virtual events that include Warped events both big and small (in the future), local and everywhere, events that are collabs with our partners, the artists, athletes, causes and cultural activations.</p>
<p>This will be a slow, deliberate, build but I think (and have been told) the most ambitious for an existing real-world community.</p>
<p>WarpedWorld will involve not only people having token-based membership, but a DAO that funds an entire ecostyem of creativity. A shift in the ownership paradigm will allow for ownership participation across the community…more to come!</p>
<p>As for brands setting up booths, of course!..we wanna build virtual and IRL events that the Nouns and all our partners have a presence.</p>
<p>As for Ugly Dolls, I actually found an old-school photo the other day with two kids rocking Ugly Doll-esque backpacks…but I tried hard to confirm if they mighta been yours and couldn’t confirm.</p>
<p>Warped was started by my friends and I at CAA and Kevin Lyman right when we were fresh out of the mailroom. Darryl Eaton, the other co-founder and a part of this project (in addition to Kevin) is co-head of music at CAA.</p>
<p>PLEASE David, reach out to me <span class="mention">@jdagogo</span> and let’s talk!</p>

<p>David, I started my career at CAA, homegrown, right out of the mailroom after a brief stint as a lawyer.</p>
<p>I worked for CAA talent icon Fred Specktor, on the new media and was lucky enough to be a part of the Coke team - leaving CAA to go work for Coke global head of marketing Peter Sealey (who recently passed away).</p>
<p>I know the web3 and crypto-ish agents well, but am not working with them. Instead very focused on my crew in the music department and music clients at this juncture. Maybe we’ll work with them more in the future…but for Warped, Darryl Eaton (co-head of music) and Kevin Lyman (the other Warped founder and heart and sole) are all we need.</p>
<p>As a part of the founding team, I founded and built the online community for Warped, which was well ahead of its time given our efforts to blur online and IRL, … and sold the early sponsorship for the tour. I also brought Sonicnet and then MTV into the Tour. I’m very proud of what we built.</p>
<p>My thought is that while CAA, which has very much been my home and where my people are, has great potential for other projects, right now, the focus of my projects involve music clients and music-related properties. IMHO the music and related projects have the best chance within the agency to onboard new audiences and creators.</p>
<p>Also, I served recently as the first and only entrepreneur in residence at Warner Bros, so I have already spoken to some of my groups there about exploration upon passage of my prop.</p>
<p>I’d love to collaborate with you. I very much view our work as being complimentary for the Nouns cause.</p>
<p>CAA has also been involved in my previous startups, and the music department and leadership have been very supportive. I don’t know if everyone in the Nouns realizes it, but having WarpedWorld potentially associated with the Nouns gets us terrific visibility at the highest levels of CAA, the other agencies, record labels, managers, artists, and the entire music ecosystem.</p>

<p>Thanks BSKlim!</p>
<p>See below my response to David re CAA, but if together, with Nouns, we rock Warped, I think we’ll be on course to work with CAA in a range of ways, should we wish to. Other agencies as well.</p>
<p>Warped is fortunate in that my biz partner on it, Darryl Eaton, is co-head of music. I’ve already spent plenty of time talking about other music projects at CAA…everyone is watching closely to see how Warped goes.</p>
<p>Also, while CAA can potentially be helpful, I think that the projects I’m bringing to the Nouns will expose all sorts of creators to the Nounish potential.</p>
<p>My former colleagues at Warner are also looking forward to getting into it, which, as you know, will not happen overnight…but I also think there are serious opportunities with the Wizarding fan community, which is both massive and very engaged.</p>
<p>Reach out if you’d like to talk more about this <span class="mention">@jdagogo</span>…but Wizard’s Hat appears in my video (coming out in the next day or two) as it was an inspiration and I’ve already shared it with the Warner/Wizarding World crew.</p>

<p>Is Warped world an actual ongoing event already or is it still in early development stages? have there been any activations, concerts , press and partners announced? What would the nouns role be? Woul it make sense with your connections to have a <a href="http://NOUNS.WTF">NOUNS.WTF</a> tour or something all about  the NOUNs and what these communities are building?<br/>
How big is united tribes? do you have much of a reach in the various entertainment Sports and music categories? What was the feedback on your pitch to WW? having worked with them I know that that team is extremely particular and picky about what they bring into their ecosystem.</p>

<p>Love this concept and think there’s a ton of value in having someone like JD out there shaking hands and making cool things happen for NounsDAO.  Warped is a massive IP in itself for a potentially huge collab, along with the other things in here- seems like a great thing to bring more special attention to Nouns to attract not just builders but connecting with industry leaders as well.</p>

<p>Hey JD! First off, I’ve enjoyed speaking to you a few times, and have found your enthusiasm contagious! lol.</p>
<p>Would love to hear a general idea or two regarding props you have been thinking about.

<p>Thanks Adam! I’ve really appreciated your advice and feedback, and it’s been amazing watching your launch. Cheers!</p>
<p>Ok! It seems I need to do some refining to this prop so that it’s super clear that I have a bunch of things lined up with the passage, also I talk about it in the video, <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://youtu.be/Zqf3GZ2wmXw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns Get Warped...and then Some! - NounsDAO Proposal - YouTube</a> but always trying to balance the amount of detail…here’s some detail!:</p>
<p><strong>1. WarpedWorld</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Warped will be a multi-prop phased approach will both require input from developers and members across the community AND I will include participation from community groups along the way. This is a huge project, I think one of the most ambitious for any existing community embracing web 3. We’ll dig in with the passage but right now, my gut tells me it’ll likely involve a few phases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a/ An initial IRL/Virtual phase where we do a series of IRL events, maybe with Vans, maybe piggybacking on live shows, but events that are all about introducing the community to WarpedWorld and educating them on web3 and Nouns. My hope is to involve a number of Nouns communities in these events so that they we are turning people on to the communites that are working in web3! I think these will spread the word in both a grassroots and Nounish way. I hope you, <span class="mention">@Aubtoshi</span> <span class="mention">@skateordao</span>, Nouns esports and many groups will find these events opportunities to proliferate! We’ll use POAPs and launch nft collections for these events that also help see the community. We may also engage the full power of Warped social to spread the word, or, alternatively, we might start slow…and grow…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second phase that will likely be all about establishing WarpedNounds as a subDAO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third phase that might be all about onboarding creators and establishing a toolkit for creators…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…and on and on…this will be a VERY BIG project that eventually will bring to life an entire ecosystem of fluid IRL and virtual community.</p>
</li>

<li>I really wanna build my Nounish development chops (and find development collaborators in the community) by executing on project for Nounish good so, as you can see in my video, have a number of possible collaborations lined up to explore with the passage. Dancing Nouns follows from the playbook that <span class="mention">@skateordao</span> has so beautifully executed on for Gnars and thatsgnar.ly - a subDAO and a related site that supports community members…and I want to do this for the pro and amateur dancing community. I have a number of interested groups ready to jump in!</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p><strong>MusicalNouns</strong> (or whatever we call it!) Another project designed to do Nounish good, but also proliferate by engaging known musicians to recognize music scholarship for the benefit of kids. I’ve been talking around town about this, and I think it not only is a way of soft-nation-building by introducing artists to the Noun to the artist community…but also use that model that Gami (mad respect!) to do good. I’ve already spoken with <span class="mention">@SuperTightWoody</span> about this a little and really hope together we can rock this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Going out to Warner Bros and others, thinking about Wizard Nouns and exploring a prop with the Wizarding World Fan Community</strong> - Something I’ve already started the ball rolling on…they are waiting for me to pass this prop, but I think the fan community (vs. the studio itself) is particuarly Nounish.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>5. Working as an evangelist and lending a strategic hand across the Nouniverse.</strong> -Whether it’s helping <span class="mention">@Aubtoshi</span> with the Coachella crew, or lending my experience and network throughout the Nouns…AND going out and educating (as I’ve been doing informally for months) people and organizations throughout my network, these efforts will produce all sorts of  proliferation, education and opportunities…I know it!</p>
<p>-Hope this is helpful, not only for you…but for anyone reading this.</p>
<p>PLEASE if you need more clarification or want to connect to discuss…reach out!</p>
<p>…and this is just tip of the iceberg…i’ve got more!!! -J.D.</p>

<p>This is a perfect amount of information! I don’t think it should be put into the proposal itself, but great to know where your head is at, and this is an impressive amount of mental work already put in <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/></p>

<p>Thank you Adam.</p>
<p>Yes, i originally had this info in the draft prop, but was advised to keep it a little more on the TLDR side!…but definitely there are very real, and quite ambitious tangible projects to dig into assuming Noun community support.</p>
<p>…and, excited about my generative covers!</p>

<p>Super exciting JD! i remember talking to you on twitter spaces about this! The branding of Nouns with the glasses goes so good with Warped, and MTV…<br/>

<p>OMFG Zack I’ve been dreaming about this one too!</p>
<p>It’s so early and I’ve tried not to overly hype, but oh yes friend, that conversation is gonna happen. -And it makes perfect sense, right?</p>
