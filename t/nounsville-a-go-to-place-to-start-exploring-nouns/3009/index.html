<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>  : A place to interact with fellow prop builders, artist with aim to educate and mentor them.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong> : With Noun’s discord closed. there is not a single place for new people exploring nouns to go, sub DAOs and communities are divided among various discord servers which has their own goals. So a place to onboard new people to nouns, telling them about Noun’s ecosystem, educate them around various sub DAOs and mentor them about the prop building. People are getting lost and have to join different servers  to spread the word about the things they wanna do with nouns.<br/>
It’s just a discussion, feel free to add what you think. A go to place for all nounish activities instead of joining different communities is the need of the hour. I dont think joining 10 different noun’s related server is necessary which has different goals around nouns.</p>
