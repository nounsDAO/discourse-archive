<p>Noggles Eth in the Gnosis wallet</p>
<p>There 11 eth sitting in the Gnosis safe that was created to supplement the fun-.0noggles production.</p>
<p>From prop: 123  Send Klim 55 ETH to be converted to 74,000 USDC<br/>
FUN Frames Multisig: 0x6C3A3374f1250597431d4ead59C35FBadf132b40<br/>
(Remainder will be sent back to the NounsDAO)</p>
<p>Due to  Eth fluctuation since the prop went up, and after the 74K was cashed out we<br/>
are still left with 11 eth that is due to be returned to the Dao.<br/>
.<br/>
Over the past few months and leading to Designer-con I have been spending thousands of dollars out of pocket to get a booth, rent display cases. Shipping samples of noggles to various NOUN activations and full cases to a few upcoming events at no charge. Fed ex pricing form China right now is about 280-380 per case and I am shipping 11-15 cases of product and samples to Dcon.<br/>
These are things that were not included in the original Noggles prop and were to be covered under “Marketing and Proliferation”  for a separate proposal that was wrapped in with the Nounish friends toys prop .<br/>
Hotel, travel for 2, booth, transportation, convention display rentals and shipping are all coming in pretty high due to the holiday travel rush, but i have no choice but to frontload it all myself in order to see my original plans through to DCON.</p>
<p>Right now more than 80% of the booth is Nouns projects.<br/>
I would love to get an OK from the dao to have <span class="mention">@joshuafisher</span>  convert that $ into USDC and use it to cover some of these expenses, Shipping, booth signage, stickers and some postcards for giveaways and onboarding.<br/>
The signage is reusable so happy to give them, additional stickers to <span class="mention">@Aubtoshi</span>  and NOTG?<br/>
The other option is to hold on to that eth and use it as a retro fund after the event but I am already too far out of pocket to self-fund booth signage, swag and additional shipping.</p>
<p>Any thoughts welcome, you can clearly see that there has always a flurry of activity related to nouns in my feed weekly, so rest assured I am not asking to fund my fun. This is all part of proliferation and it would be great for any photo ops, interviews and appearances.</p>
<p>I have about a week to get these things to printers  and ship to my hotel in Anaheim</p>
<p>Thanks for your support.</p>
<p>Klim</p>
<p>you can see a lot of our activity on <span class="mention">@nounworks</span> twitter and instagram</p>
