<p>Our team has a project proposal called “Nouns Tribe.”  The complete proposal is available at:  <a href="https://www.crouns.wtf/proposal" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.crouns.wtf/proposal</a>. Here is a summarized version:</p>
<p>We see an inclusive future where 50 Nouns-derivatives are born each day. The Nouns DAO github repo has been there for others to fork, yet there has not been any meaningful Nouns “descendants”. We are proposing a system for creating DAO’s that inherit from Nouns, all working together as a community we have dubbed the “Nouns Tribe.”  Here’s one possible future:</p>

<p>The example above illustrates how each descendant has a meaningful purpose as part of the Nouns ecosystem. Further, each Nouns-derived DAO will differ as expected.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crouns: supports basic research</li>
<li>MD.Nouns: medical research</li>
<li>PhD.Nouns: non-medical research</li>
<li>Charity.Nouns: donations &amp; events for charity</li>
</ul>
<p>To realize this vision, we propose the development of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Crouns: This is the first proper descendant of Nouns. Couns’ main purpose is to support and promote the structured creation of Noun descendants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Playbook for Forking DAO: We propose to document our process and offer templates and a guide for forking NoundsDAO github to create a Nouns-derivative DAO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tribe Registry: A set of Ethereum contracts for both the registration and administration of Nouns descendants, including Identity Access Management (IAM) for dapps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nouns Tribe Events dapp: This is the first dapp that works with the Tribe Registry, allowing any avatar in the Nouns Tribe to host and participate in an online event.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything is public domain and available on github, just like the Nouns project.</p>
<p>Our team has been big fans of Nouns since its launch. A month ago, we started designing a community and ecosystem for any NFT collection to join as long as they are permissioned. We re-read the Nouns credo, and the following inspired us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we should be bold with the Nouns DAO treasury. We should fund and cultivate a community of builders by experimenting, taking risks, and ultimately funding every high quality proposal that could lead to interesting culture and software (especially ‘middleware’)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We realized our project is a great fit for the Nouns ecosystem.  Again, the full proposal is available at <a href="https://www.crouns.wtf/proposal" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.crouns.wtf/proposal</a>.  We first introduced this proposal shortly after Christmas in the introduction sections of this discourse, but we realized few saw it.  We are hoping to get a few excited Nouners to sponsor our proposal and officially submit it for voting.</p>
<p>Thank you if you read this far!</p>
