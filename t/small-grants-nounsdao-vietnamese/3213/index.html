<p>So cool to see different nations coming on board! Have you started any of this work yet? If not, you may want to connect with the InternatioNouns discord as well and get plugged in there. There are a lot of artists and community leaders doing similar things in other nations and they may be able to help, offer advice, and even share the platform they are building. If you desire is small grants, they also have a discord that would be worth pinging as well.</p>
<p>Best of luck and keep building!</p>

<p>Love seeing other countries brought on board. The pointer to InternatioNouns is a great resource. Also, The NounSquare and their discord. Not sure if they have a Vietnam channel but great place to meet people and get some traction.</p>
<p>Iâ€™d love to hear a little more about your Nounish journeyâ€¦how did you hear about Nouns and how long have you been around and whatâ€™s been helpful in learning about Nouns and Nouns culture?</p>

<p>I participated in a Noun contest and saw the enthusiasm from the NOUNS members, they come from not only one place but many parts of the world. I tried to find people to share my country with but almost and even none. So in me cherished the ambition to build a NOUNS community in Vietnam and bring our cultures into NOUNS, build and develop the great things that NOUNS can discover. Vietnam is a fertile land that NOUNS can explore and I am honored to be given the opportunity and do it.</p>
