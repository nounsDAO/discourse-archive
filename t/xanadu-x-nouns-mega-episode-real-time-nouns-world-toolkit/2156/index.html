<p>Dear NounsDAO,</p>
<p>Welcome to Xanadu… a story world made by one dude with godlike creation powers forging a new category of entertainment that twists fiction with reality and collides pop culture with the coolest things on the internet. It’s a wild, novel genre that’s inspiring a new generation of creators, artists, and storytellers.</p>

</a>
</div>
<p>We’re a team of two with a shared passion for bringing avatars and worlds to life. We want to help bring Nouns into the 3D metaverse with our unique storytelling and world-building skills. We propose a XANADU x NOUNS collaboration consisting of two parts:</p>
<p><big> <strong>Part One - Nouns Episode of Xanadu</strong> </big></p>
<p>We would create a mega-episode of Xanadu where Blu, the hero of Xanadu, teams up with Nouns in an action-packed deep dive into the Nouns Universe.</p>
<p>The episode features Blu questing through Planet Nouns desperate for the Nouns help to save him from a posse of intergalactic gangsters. To satisfy the bounty on his head, Blu must submit a winning proposal to Nouns DAO which kicks off a wild escapade through the Nouns City Center, the historic Nouner Capitol building, and the Nouns Underground. Along the way, Blu meets a master Noun who gives him a crash course on NounsDAO, how it works and why it’s awesome — education disguised as Hollywood quality entertainment.  But it doesn’t stop there…</p>

<p><big> <strong>Part Two - CC0 Nouns Toolkit</strong> </big></p>
<p>Unlike a Hollywood feature where all the creativity and work vanish after the movie’s made, all of the Nouns assets created for this episode will be crafted into a Nouns World Toolkit that will live on in an innovative and powerful new way — in the hands of the community, available CC0.<br/>
This is more than a simple library of assets…</p>
<p>Because Xanadu is built in a game engine (Unreal Engine 5), it’s a story world that can be cinematic, interactive, gamified, live-streamed, or experienced in VR. So, armed with this massive toolkit of AAA animatable Nouns characters &amp; pre-lit, animated environments — complete with how-to guide books &amp; tutorials created by us — the Nouns community can inhabit a Noun for VTubing, Zoom calls, or create cinematic content, marketing materials, NFTs, or even build a Nouns VR experience, game, or metaverse. It’s our hope for this to become the beginning of a dynamic Nouns repository that grows over time and is contributed to by other builders.</p>
<p><em>Full list of Toolkit deliverables below in Extra Details.</em></p>
<p><strong>How does this benefit NounsDAO?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The Episode</strong> — Exposure for NounsDAO in a novel, powerful narrative – with analytics &amp; insights (average results per episode: 2.7M impressions, 321K views, 12K watch-time hours)</li>
<li>
<strong>The Toolkit</strong> — 3D tools that enables Nouns creators, creations, remixes with other IPs, and continued proliferation of Nouns to a new degree.</li>
<li>
<strong>Our Vision</strong> — Inspire creators with the episode, enable creations with the toolkit, and catalyze a cohort of Nouns as VTubers and next-generation virtual avatars.</li>
</ol>
<p><big> <strong>Community</strong> </big><br/>
Working directly with the Nouns community is key for this project in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help choose what Nouns derivatives to feature such as LilNouns, SharkDAO, skateboards from GnarsDAO, and art pieces from prop house. We love the extended Nouns community want to infuse this thriving ecosystem into the Toolkit and Episode.</li>
<li>Help define the 3D style of the Nouns characters and environments, as well as how Nouns express themselves using motion capture and animation.</li>
<li>Help choose Nouns characters to be featured in the episode. Some Nouns will be chosen for story purposes but we’d love the community to vote on what other Nouns get featured. Those Nouns holders will have the option to voice &amp; motion capture their own Noun (assuming there’s dialogue).</li>

<p><big><strong>Extra Details</strong></big></p>
<p><big><strong>The Nouns World Toolkit Repository</strong></big><br/>
The CC0 repository will consist of the cast of Nouns characters and environments made for the episode. Everything will be set up in the Unreal Engine (Free game engine software) and we’re going to include all the scenes, cameras, lighting and animation from the episode which means, the Nouns City center will be alive with ambient animation and amazing cinematic lighting. Additionally, the scenes from the episode will provide a starting point for making new content that looks amazing. All the Nouns characters will be rigged and ready for motion capture style animation (Both face and body similar to how Blu is setup in Xanadu). For those with the right gear, this means you can instantly puppet any of those Nouns for V-Tubbing or creating your own cinematic content. We’re also exploring ‘off the shelf’ webcam mocap solutions (Cheap or free but body motion quality not as good as the expensive mocap suites) to include, if possible, to make inhabiting the nouns characters more accessible. This would also allow using Nouns for Zoom calls, etc.</p>

<p><strong>About Xanadu &amp; beyond</strong><br/>
The heart of Xanadu is its zany stories and wild characters, but its soul burns to bridge and play in other universes. Thus Blu wants to help bring to life the budding spectrum of web3 Pop-Cultures from Nouns, cloneX and BAYC to small burgeoning Avatar projects backed by talented teams or individuals. All so they can collide on a bigger, more wild stage, with bigger, more wild crossover stories! Think Ready Player One and the Marvel Universe but creator content style!</p>
<p><strong>FUN BONUS IDEA: Wild Story Twist!</strong><br/>
Blu’s adventure with the Nouns will live on beyond this episode in a ‘first-of-its-kind’ melding of entertainment &amp; reality; After this episode airs, Blu’s fictional proposal (The one he formulates in the episode with help from the Nouns) is actually a real proposal that he submits to the Nouns DAO… and the outcome of that proposal dictates Blu’s future storyline – Will his proposal be good enough for approval, or will Blu have to evade the gangsters and find another solution to survive?</p>

<p>This is such a fascinating proposal and your teaser is out of this world. Obviously it’s a big ask, but there’s a lot of value to consider here as well. I wanted to get a couple of clarifications.</p>
<p>Your average views and impressions look higher than the raw numbers on Youtube. Do you cross post to other platforms? Do you market the episodes somehow?</p>
<p>It looks like you have 4 episodes so far, is that accurate? There was also a dropoff in the views for episode 4 compared to the others. Did that one have less marketing or is there anything you can attribute it to? I do some Youtube stuff, nowhere near this level of quality, so I didn’t know if you could provide any insights there.</p>
<p>The tooling is over my head, but it sure sounds exciting and useful to a whole host of content creation and game design, so I’m hoping a lot of other people will come and ask questions and give feedback. Congrats on an incredible prop!</p>

          <div class="post_content">
<p>Thanks for the props and interest Andrew!</p>
<p>For the YT views we used the average of all the episodes.  I’ve not done any official marketing for the episodes but I generally promote them on twitter, linked-in, instagram and a couple ‘avatar’ groups with a trailer.  I also put episode snippets on TikTok but I’m not sure if there’s much crossover there?</p>
<p>For Episode 4, I’d say the biggest reason is the 5 month gap in uploads which we know the algorithm hates! The early episodes were going up a lot faster with short stuff in-between. My last thought is, I didn’t get to promote E4 at all thanks to a wacky health injury that knocked me on my ass for the first part of the year.  Hence the crickets since E4.</p>
<p>Looking ahead,  there’s a bunch of exciting content heavily in the works, both new episodes and lots of short content.  And Stephen (my other half in this proposal) is the Hattori Hanzo of YT and brining a strong strategy for blowing Xanadu up!</p>
<p>Was your Youtube stuff virtual character oriented? I feel like the interest in virtual character content is rising, partially because all this ‘metaverse’ stuff flying around but also just because it’s super cool with endless potential and it’s actually possible now without big teams.  Crazy to think what this space will be like in even two years.</p>

<p>I think Blu is able to help Nouns reaching new frontiers:</p>
<p>The first is 3d and the way he humanizes the characters. It is better than everything we’ve seen so far. Hollywood quality animation.</p>
<p>Second is bringing Nouns looks and lore into a different environment. From pixelated and cartoonish to a cinematic/gaming aesthetics. This is important to reach new communities</p>
<p>Third is the awareness blu channel already has.</p>
<p>Nouns is about ‘seeing differently’ (pun not intended, this is definitely a brand idea), and should support the greatest creativity around. There isn’t much left to discuss here.</p>

<p>Good question with a few answers…<br/>
Every episode cost is directly tied to the script and in the case of Xanadu, typically the biggest cost is designing and creating the assets (Characters, Environments &amp; Props).  Thus, if I was to create a second Nouns episode it would be significantly cheaper because I’d already have a huge pool of assets to work with.  So unless the new story called for creating something new, you could automatically cut out the cost of concept art + 3d modeling &amp; Texturing + Character modeling &amp; Rigging.</p>
<p>The second answer is because the Nouns World toolkit would be CC0 and includes Unreal Engine 5 scenes with all those Nouns characters and Environments ready to go, other creators can make their own episodes with an incredible starting point – not just with the assets, lighting, animation &amp; camera work that’s included in the scenes but the episode itself would have established the beginning of a Nouns storyline as well as developed many of the hero characters (personalities, backstories, etc…)</p>
<p>This is most exciting because different creators would bring different vibes and storytelling styles. They can riff off the story and characters I started or scrap all that and make up their own from scratch.  They can also introduce other outside characters aside from Blu, like cloneX’s show up to Nouns Square… or Godzilla!</p>
<p>**What would be super cool is if you guys (maybe Prop House specifically?) ran a contest… calling all film makers &amp; storytellers… (Interested in this style of content creation) and gave out Eth prizes for creating new Nouns Stories using the Toolkit. I imagine some wild stuff would come from this! Then those winners could collab on a bigger episode?!</p>
<p>phew… and you just wanted to know the cost of additional episodes <img alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=12" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" width="20"/></p>

<p>This looks amazing and I love that it’s as much about creating and making assets available cc0/open source for others to use. I can see this being incredibly beneficial for students, especially those in digital media design. Would love to see this funded but concerned that the large ask may be a challenge. Is there a way to break down the budget into smaller chunks that could be tacked onto specific deliverables?</p>

<p>Love this prop, and love what you did using <a href="http://www.3Dnouns.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.3Dnouns.com</a> assets. Best extension of an extension, and this is exciting to see a creative CC0 stack in the making.</p>
<p>I am not going to pretend that this isn’t a very large ask, and I would prefer to see it broken into phases if possible.</p>
<p>20 Eth for rigging 12 face+body and 24 body assets is a lot since the assets are pretty much ready out of 3D nouns website (even though I’m sure they need a bit of fine tuning, mesh optimisation  and paint weighting).</p>
<p>I also would be curious to see the style of the environments you are going to make. I know this can be a lot of work depending on the resolution and I feel like they play a huge part in defining the mood and aesthetic. Would like to see some drafts, concepts, or even one or two assets finished to get a sense of the aesthetic and if they can be reused for other purposes down the line (say a video game, that would add a fourth layer to the cc0 stack). I would not be so stoked of the assets felt too generic and bought online instead of crafted the nounish way (devils in the details).</p>
<p>Characters and assets are adding up to 100 ETH and, as a 3D person myself, I feel like this is a little too much (although could be acceptable depending on the quality of env assets). For that price I think you should get <strong>ALL nouns body and face rigged and open the floodgates for nounish CGI and filmmaking using game engines</strong>.<br/>
3D nouns gave you the models and textures, let’s take it one step further.</p>
<p>Obviously I love the work, and the way you approached the community (dms first, then twitter, then discourse etc you set a great example). Great vibe overall and would absolutely want this prop to succeed, I just feel like a bit more details are needed to fire up such a large transaction.</p>
<p>As a general comment, I would like to see large props broken into phases using sablier or multiple on chain submissions.</p>
<p>Thanks for the prop, very exciting!</p>

<p>I would personally prefer more Nouns and less environments. We have 242 Noun heads, and to get only 12 of them fully rigged seems like a missed opportunity for other creators to express themselves with these characters. I’d prefer the story and video length be scaled back in order to accommodate more Nouns.</p>

<p>Thx for the input Coralorca and your props on the prop!<br/>
It was awesome grabbing the 3Dnouns for the proposal video but I’m planning to build all the episode / toolkit nouns from scratch in a different style. It’s super important to me the Nouns faces have a vibrant ability to express themselves using facial capture / mocap. Given the style and variety of nouns faces, this translation is a fairly big undertaking and will involve an elaborate custom face rig for each character depending mainly on their mouths and how their overall face can deform, etc.  It’s not a trivial thing to make sure each unique character has a great smile, frown and talking style that fits their personality. It’s one of the qualities I think makes Blu connectable and I put a lot of effort into those details when building him. Same with the bodies, they will be unique per hero noun and take on a certain design + level of rigging for animation and motion capture.</p>
<p>Overall I’m approaching this through a Pixar lens, meaning a lot of energy will go into the quality, design, expressivity &amp; uniqueness of both the characters and the environments. Not saying we’re going to hit Pixar level per se but we’ll strive too and I think we’ll blow some minds with where we land. I’m a world building fanatic so you don’t have to worry about the environments being generic or not nounish. Plus I’ll be sharing concept art with the community from the get go and consider all feedback to make sure it hits the bullseye.  Nouns are super iconic and the world I’m going to build will do it justice!</p>
<p>I also would love nothing more than to have the entire Nouns lineup be setup at the<br/>
‘Hero nouns level’ but this first initiative is focused more on establishing an amazing translation of the Nouns universe into an exciting 3d world with incredible character expressibility &amp; animation.<br/>
The idea is from here, a great blueprint for expanding the environments and translating / creating hero nouns will have been established and made available where others can continue to build on and expand the universe within a cohesive style and quality.  Plus the story will act as inspiration and will have established characters and story arcs that can also be built on &amp; expanded.<br/>
A phase 2 proposal could easily be made to use the recipe and build out the rest of the Nouns in one go.</p>
<p>Speaking about phases, I understand you guys don’t know what’s in my head so there’s a bit of faith in what will be delivered but I can promise you I’m coming into this at the highest level I can achieve (as I do all my projects) and you will not be disappointed!  The current proposal structure will give us the best shot at making/starting something incredible given our team size, timeline and pace of creation.</p>
<p>Hope that helps clarify a few things, I realize I should have put more of these details into the proposal. Don’t hesitate to hit me back on any of this!</p>

<p>This looks like an amazing prop Blu. Particularly the toolkit that you’ll be creating and making available to the community. We think the “How to Docs and Tutorials” if done well will be really beneficial to creators. RTFKT have done a great job with their release of CloneX 3D models and tutorials for holders, turning collectors and enthusiasts into builders that help proliferate the brand. One of the co-founders, Benoit is a raven head Noun holder. Busy guy, but might be worthwhile trying to get in touch with him for some Nouner support. We’d love to see Nounish builders create content once they have the rigged assets and tutorials to help them build.</p>
<p>Would love to hear more from you on the toolkit details and what you plan on creating in terms of docs and tutorials. Will this be aimed at experienced builders, or will you be developing tools for the lowest common denominator user? The latter would be great.</p>

<p>Thanks ThaSwami and good idea to reach out to Benoit!</p>
<p>Our aim for the toolkit is to make it as easy as possible for a beginner to make cool content so most of the docs and tutorials will be aimed at the beginner and a few things intermediate.  I would point out the toolkit will be rooted in the Unreal Engine which is free, insanely fun and amazing but like any big software, there’s a real learning curve involved.  Our tutorials will assume basic understanding of the Unreal Engine and there’s tons of tutorials online for that.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a few people pick up the unreal engine really fast (Non 3d people) and start making amazing stuff in a short time so I’m confident if there’s a creative will to create in this Nouns Toolkit sandbox, learning Unreal won’t be a problem!

Good question; I was using that line to draw attention to what’s possible with just one dude (all previous Xanadu episodes were made by just me) so imagine what a small talented team could do… that kind of thing.  The Nouns episode is a big big one mainly because it involves designing and building a big slice of the world including a cast of new characters so a team is essential, plus they’re gonna help elevate everything way beyond what I can do myself <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/></p>

As for Nouns community member involvement, keep tabs on our new channel on Discord, that’ll be home base for various ops as we get ramped up and rolling with production.  I’ll likely make some form of roadmap showing the different known opportunities and I’m sure some will spontaneously erupt along the way.
