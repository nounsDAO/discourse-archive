<p>Hi, I’m in Delaware USA and I am a Real Estate Broker and LOVE the NOUNS concept.  I also see a huge need for affordable housing everywhere! Tiny homes are the perfect answer to affordable homeownership.  I have done extensive research on what it will take to create a tiny home community and am proposing we start a Noun Community of tiny homes that could be structured across the world as Noun Towns! The residents would be diverse but all have a goal of minimalism and enjoying the land on which they live.  This type of lifestyle would also alllow the freedom to travel and enjoy life more as they won’t be using most of their income on housing.  Who is ready to get started on Noun Town!</p>
