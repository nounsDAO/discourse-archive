<p><strong>WTF?</strong></p>
<p>1908 DAO is like Nouns but <strong>Animated</strong> and with an additional ecosystem, an <strong>experimental meme incubation</strong> studio.</p>
<p>A DAO expansion based on Nouns DAO and TungstenDAO.  1908 DAO works to create a new, closer communication between art, and the noun ecosystem;  <strong>Art is the noblest and purest way for the Nouns meme to proliferate</strong>.  By expanding the ecosystem, 1908 DAO aims to efficiently proliferate the Nouns meme and consequently invite great artists to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>• One Animated Noun is trustlessly auctioned every 12 hours, forever.</p>
<p>• 100% of Animated Noun auction proceeds are trustlessly sent to the treasury.</p>
<p>• Settlement of one auction kicks off the next.</p>
<p>• All Animated Nouns are members of 1908 DAO.</p>
<p>• One animated Noun is equal to one vote.</p>
<p>• The treasury is controlled exclusively by Animated Nouns via governance.</p>
<p>• Every 7 days an artwork/meme is auctioned.</p>
<p>• The meme auction is exclusive to <strong>Animated Nouns</strong>.</p>
<p>• Artists are encouraged through the ecosystem to create new artwork/meme inspired by Nouns.</p>
<p>• A minimum of <strong>1 Animated Noun</strong> and a <strong>1/1 Noun meme</strong> is required to submit proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Meme Incubation Nouns</strong></p>
<p>1908 DAO in its ecosystem is an artist incubator for artists with special memetic talents.</p>
<p>1908 DAO will have an open process for submitting original memes inspired by nouns, as well as inviting great artists to collaborate with the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>( Consider that a large list of highly regarded artists has already been made, and the support of these artists has already been confirmed. )</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the above information as a trailer for a great work, new information will be added in the coming days, as well as the reveal of the team and its advisors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Additional Information :</strong></p>
<p>Why 1908?</p>
<p>The first animation in history appeared in the year 1908.</p>
<p>The short of just over 1 minute was made in 1908 and is the work of Frenchman Émile Cohl, known as the father of animation.  The story begins with the artist’s own hand drawing a doll that goes through a series of crazy transformations, from clown to knight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A DAO for memes related to nouns can be very interesting!  Especially when great artists are invited.  Curious to see new memes and how far the engine can be pushed.</p>
