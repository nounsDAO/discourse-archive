<p>Proposal to design digital ESL products to create brand awareness of NOUNs and WEB3</p>
<p>What we will deliver:</p>
<p>-Printable, Nounimals ESL Coloring Books, ABC Tracing Guides Workbook, Kindergarten Math Workbook</p>
<p>-Printable, Nounimals ‘Colors’ Classroom poster</p>
<p>-Printable ‘nounimals matching’ card game set</p>
<p>Funding Required: 4 ETH (2 ETH for Proof of Concept / 2 ETH upon delivery)</p>
<p>Concept:</p>
<p>We have recently begun using worksheets and materials that incorporate NOUNS ‘noggles’ at our school in Japan at the preschool and kindergarten levels and to a lesser extent at the elementary school level. Since character art and fashion are highly esteemed fields in Japan, end-users at even a very early age are quite specific and critical in their tastes. It was very pleasing to see how well received the Nounimals game and worksheets were received.</p>
<p>Our goal with this project is to kick off a series of printable classroom materials, as listed above to be made available for direct download by educators and parents in the NOUNS community worldwide.</p>
<p>The potential for classroom products and educational resources for the NOUNS brand is enormous, considering it’s meme-nature and positive, upbeat nature. Let’s spread the nounish feeling to each classroom around the world.</p>
<p>Why Nouns?</p>
<p>Since entering the NFT space as an artist and collector in September 202, CC0 projects have been a huge area of interest for me and my company. As a creator and educator, I have been using CC0 audio files for several years in the creation of education video and audio supplements.</p>
<p>About Us:</p>
<p>We are MUKIMU Workshop. Our ESL school is located in a Kagoshima City, a small town in the countryside of southern Japan. MUKIMU is a made up word meaning mental muscle, based the Japanese word, ‘muki-muki’.</p>
<p>MUKIMU was founded in 2013 by my wife and I (Mr.Brian Design) who both have a background in education and design. My wife was a seigner and product manager at New Era Japan (apparel) and my background is in the kids toy industry, specifically preschool and baby hardgoods. In the early 2000’s I was a leader in the toy art movement in New York. My resume includes; Alife NYC, Bandai, Biz Markie, Cube Works, Fisher Price, Hasbro, and Stussy Japan.</p>
<p>In 2009, while living in Tokyo as a stay home dad and designer, I began creating coloring books and ESL materials for my daughter and other kids in our apartment building. Eventually I began making my ESL materials as downloadable printables in the web 2.0 ecosystem. In 2011 I began working at a large Japanese kindergarten in Tokyo and quickly began learning the ESL industry and what was necessary to teach young kids a foreign language, lots of fun activities.</p>
<p>Since those early days I built a thriving local business with over a hundred students currently enrolled based on the library of ESL materials, including; self-published and downloadable workbooks, classroom posters, flashcards, and card games.</p>
<p>The concept of MUKIMU is active learning, to learn through doing. We help our students learn creative skills, we play games, sing, and dance and hold arts and crafts workshops.</p>
<p>My goal is to collaborate with the NOUNs Dao and community to produce and / or make available NOUNs based ESL and universal early learning education materials in the same fashion as I have been doing for the past decade. The NOUNs materials that I recently to use with my current studentswent over extremely well. The ESL communities throughout Japan, Asia, and the world is a strong channel to spread the NOUNish vibes and bring awareness to the NOUNs movement.</p>
<p>Here is a link to a short video showing the work I have been doing at my school in Japan with NOUNS worksheets and card games:</p>
