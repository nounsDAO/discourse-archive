<p>gm Nouns Community, Nich here from <a href="https://twitter.com/1kxnetwork" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">1kx</a> (++<a href="https://twitter.com/PublicNouns" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Public Nouns</a>!). I am leading our efforts for the next edition of Macro Hackathons, a hackathons series focusing on nascent verticals in web3. The theme of the upcoming edition is web3 social and are looking for co-presenters to help with developer engagement. With all the activity and innovation happening in the Nouns community we’d love to see if you would be interested in getting involved here.</p>
<p>Unlike sponsors, this wouldn’t be a monetary commitment but instead community activation and co-marketing, as we want to increase the conversion rate for builders who sign up and submit a project.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Macro_Hacks" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Macro Hackathons</a> is an initiative by <a href="https://twitter.com/1kxnetwork" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">1kx</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMacroDAO" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Macro DAO</a> with the goal to bring together a community of builders to innovate on emerging verticals in web3. We launched the first edition with <a href="https://medium.com/macrohacks/macro-hackathons-nft-finance-edition-recap-winner-showcase-8fd3893b206e" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NFT Finance</a>, and our next edition will be focused on web3 social. We hope this hackathon series could seed some of the most impactful projects and primitives in the space. This is a virtual event that takes place entirely on Discord, Zoom, and gather.town.</p>
<p>Some stats from the first edition of Macro Hackathons (NFT Finance edition):</p>
<ul>
<li>170 developers with a 21% conversion rate to submissions</li>

<p>We (1kx) will run hackathon operations and logistics on our end (agenda, communications, sponsor, judge, mentor management etc.). We are looking for co-presenters who are leaders in web3 social and can help market this to their communities: on Twitter, newsletters, Discord channels etc.</p>
<p>With Macro Hackathons: Web3 Social edition, we want to improve our reach and conversion rate of submitted projects to 400 developers and 40% conversion to submitted projects. As a strong voice in web3 social, we believe your help in co-promotion and involvement in the hackathon will help us to reach this goal.</p>
<p>Along with initial co-promotion, we’re looking for co-presenters to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appear on an AMA session or panel to share your past learnings, trends, what you’re excited about, current opportunities and challenges in web3 social</li>
<li>Do periodic announcements on your channels to highlight the hackathon progress and bounties (can exclusively be your own)</li>
<li>Have a representative from your project on the judging panel</li>
