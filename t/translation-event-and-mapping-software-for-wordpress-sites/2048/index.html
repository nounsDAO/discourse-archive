Nouns Blog</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>tl;dr</h2><p>For just under $4k we can provide infrastructure to promote global IRL activations, see what Nounish virtual events are happening in different languages (Spanish/Portuguese/more TwitterSpaces), help non-English speaking people get onboarded to <a href="http://thenounsquare.info/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://thenounsquare.info/</a> as listeners as well as guests, and much much more.  let’s gooo</p><h2>What I've been up to</h2>
Since April, I have been working on Nounish Projects, many of which have been WordPress sites. I am on the NounPress team, so any work that I do will also be available for that project. Additionally, all of these are cc0.
<br/><p>Projects are often limited because the builders didn’t plan for the cost of amazingness. They often don’t even know what is available.Though we can do a fair job with free plugins we can seriously expand our proliferation with several WordPress plugins and API connections. After looking at the costs of the plugins for the sites that I am working on, I found that it is less expensive to buy large licenses in some cases. I would like to purchase the WordPress Plugins and API services below, and where there are extras, distribute them to Nounish Buidlers in the same way that metamonk distributes nouns.domains.  First come first served, unless you prefer an approval process.  In which case, I am happy to facilite that.</p><h4>Live Sites</h4><p><a href="http://thenounsquare.info/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://thenounsquare.info/</a><br/>

$1,999 per year will cover 10 sites</p><p>This is a suite of plugins for events, which include, among other things:</p><ul>
<li>Mapping</li>
<li>Allowing users to search for events by category, tag, venue, organizer, day of the week, time of day, and price.</li>
<li>Advanced filtering in the back end</li>
<li>Advanced Widgets</li>
<li>Recurring Events</li>
<li>Venue and Organizer Pages</li>
<li>Support for Virtual Events</li>
</ul><h4>Google maps API Service</h4>
The above also requires a billing account for the google maps API. That has been free so far, but I will keep my eye on it. :)
<h3>Translation APIs and plugins</h3>
From Google: “If you live in an English-speaking country, you may not have considered translating your website content. However, webmasters are increasingly recognising the importance of including content that appeals to a global audience, and which addresses them in their mother-tongue languages. After all, just 27% of Internet users are English speaking according to the World Internet Statistics. Moreover, a study carried out by the Common Sense Advisory found that a massive 85% of online shoppers would only purchase from websites that discussed the products in their own language even if they were able to understand other languages used on the site.”
<p>Both of the translation plugins below allow users to override machine translation on a case by case basis. Having worked with Nounish Builders in 6 different languages, we found that both are required for those 6 languages to be understandable. Between the two, over 40 languages will be available on our websites.</p><h4>DeepL Pro API</h4><p><a href="https://www.deepl.com/pro#team" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.deepl.com/pro#team</a><br/>
DeepL is known to be the best available machine translation mechanism. There is no limit to the number of websites that can use it. The cost is $65.88 for 500,000 characters/month + $25.00 per 1 million characters.</p><h4>TranslatePress</h4><p><a href="https://translatepress.com/pricing/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://translatepress.com/pricing/</a><br/>
Connects DeepL to WP and provides widgets, shortcodes, etc. for language switching.<br/>

<p>Thanks!  None of these sites have been promoted at this point, as most of them still need further design, SEO work, and content managers. I am still studying what team is needed to really keep them up.  They are mostly used by staff to keep track of events.</p>
<p>Twitter is not great as a base for a few reasons.  The primary issue is allowing people to have these events in their calendars in advance, or to be able to easily see what Nounish events are happening across platforms (discord/youtube/etc.).  Hosts cannot setup spaces very far in advance, to allow people to know what is going to be happening.  Many of us tune out twitter reminders on our phones, so miss those reminders even if we had them set.  The plugin that i want to use allows you to add the calendars to various platforms (iCal, google, etc.).  Twitter also does not show everything out there.  What you see depends heavily on which accounts you have followed, so can’t cover new things, which we have popping up daily.  And, twitter can’t make the awesome map of what is happening IRL.  Which is just fun to see.</p>
<p><a href="http://Internationouns.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Internationouns.com</a> could easily be crowd sourced.  Many have expressed interest but onboarding has been very slow, and Nounish builders don’t have much time to maintain such things. I have started a very casual SoapBox on The Noun Square on Fridays at noon ET, which has caused further interest.</p>

<p>Automatic translation can cover 40+ languages.  We tried with The Noun Square site to do some of them by hand, but by the time they were translated the events/contests would be over.</p>
<p>That is less of an issue for permanent pages and recurring events, but to really get it all, for everyone, every day, automatic seems a clear winner.  The work in that case is simply to have folks let us know if something doesn’t translate well, and adjust the English.  As far as the time of Nounish Builders goes, it is more important to me that the information get in there to begin with, which is the major challenge at this point.</p>

<p>I am hoping we can push this through.  Currently internatioNouns has about 40 categories coming in from various sources.  Ideally, I would be able to filter for my projects ie: nouncil, TNS, FOODNOUNS, etc., then by “Team Calls”.  Each person needs different views, and we can’t do that without this advanced functionality.</p>
<p>I am currently manually hiding a bunch of them so that things are reasonably coherent.<br/>
