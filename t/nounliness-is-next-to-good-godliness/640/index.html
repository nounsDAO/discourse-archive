<p>I’m developing an adult party card game similar to Cards Against Humanity.  I think it would be cool to use a Noun on the cover of the box, I also have plans to incorporate at least one Noun as a game card (see example).</p>
<p>Credit for cover art will be prominent with Nouns.wtf listed as the source.</p>
<p>I intend to create NFT’s in general for marketing and perks for preorders, etc.  Later add-ons may only be digital and act as a bridge between a physical IRL game and digital NFT’s.</p>
<p>I leave it up to the amazing brains behind Nouns to decide if they like the idea of this game or not - if so, I think it could make a great collaboration opportunity to put Nouns on a product that everyday people will see and appreciate, as well as prominently linking back to Nouns.</p>
<p>The game is tailored to ages 17+, however I do have the intent of creating a kid friendly version (Good Golly) which I think would be a great opportunity for Nouns as well.</p>
<p>The link to the game project page is below.  I am still writing out the cards, but the concept is very easy to grasp.  Thanks for looking.  Please reach out to me here or via the game’s discord channel with questions/comments!  I would love to partner with Nouns to spread The Good God Word!</p>
