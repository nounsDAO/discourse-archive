<h2><a class="anchor" href="#tldr-1" name="tldr-1"></a>TL;DR</h2>
<p>An experimental venture studio for the Nouniverse, ready to fund and spin up powerful Nounish models that will target domain specific applications.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#background-2" name="background-2"></a>Background</h3>
<p><a href="https://nouns.wtf/vote/51">Proposal 51</a> rewarded the extremely nounish <a href="https://gnars.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gnars DAO</a> with 69 ETH to sponsor <a href="https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1546479275280584704" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns Athletes</a> after a 3 ETH <a href="/t/small-grants-nouns-athletes/731">proof of concept</a> funded by <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nounsgrants" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Small Grants</a>, which along with a myriad of other nounish experiments, informs this proposal and its approach in solving for proliferation (as opposed to propagation).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#h-0-1-n-3" name="h-0-1-n-3"></a>0 → 1 → N</h2>
<p>Nouns DAO exists to facilitate a virtuous cycle of “proliferation” and yet despite our success, most of what we have funded is in fact “propagation.” This is most likely a function of first needing to occupy our own space (propagate) before we can divide and conquer (proliferate).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As nouns the <a href="https://wikidiff.com/propagation/proliferation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">difference between propagation and proliferation</a> is that propagation is the multiplication or natural increase in a population while proliferation is (uncountable) the process by which an organism produces others of its kind; breeding, propagation, procreation, reproduction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Small Grants was formed to facilitate the issuance of smaller grants. By spreading our bets across a broader subset of opportunities we’ve accelerated propagation. In some cases we’ve enabled early examples of proliferation by funding various proof of concept proposals as a “validation” step.</p>

<p><strong>NOUN HAUS</strong> is an alternative to Small Grants who <em>maximise daotput</em> by empowering communities, artists and entrepreneurs to proliferate Nouns as domain specific extensions – from <em>zero to one to n.</em></p>
<p><strong>0 → 1 → N</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>0 = validate</li>
<li>1 = propagate</li>
<li>N = proliferate</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bauhaus</a> and akin to having an ‘entreprenouner’ in residence, NOUN HAUS is well poised for the arrival of <a href="https://nouns.build" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns Builder</a> and is testament to <a href="https://youtu.be/O1iA8kQul4o?t=3511" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">what Noun 22 said on Bankless</a> when you consider the impending onslaught of nounish extensions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think what’s critical to the future of scaling the dao […] is finding other ways to do small grants programs that get one to two ETH into the hands of as many talented builders as we can and then use that as a way to onboard them to the dao and then scale up their contributions…</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1554994068844716032" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">A key insight gained</a> through our six months of full-time (and capital) dedication to Nouns is that smaller sized grants VALIDATE so builders can PROPAGATE; but it’s extensions that PROLIFERATE ⌐◨-◨</p>

<p>After a self inflicted Nouns-pilling in the early months of Nouns DAO’s launch, he was immediately drawn to the elegance of the protocol and shifted everything he was doing to become nounish af. About 9 months on, we’re witnessing the birth of the nounish pro-liferatooooors in a team of ultra passionate and dedicated builders.</p>

<li>Proactive member of <a href="https://twitter.com/nouncil" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouncil</a>, hosting 1 of 2 weekly Nouncil calls, handling admin of new memberships and trusted member of the Nouncil multi-sig crew.</li>
<li>Ran an independent art contest with the Nouncil Permissionless Grant that achieved impressive statistics in terms of impressions of and engagement with nounish art.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Noun Square</a> founding team, host, admin and trusted member of the multi-sig crew. The Noun Square is a daily twitter space celebrating Noun O’Clock, every day, forever.</li>
<li>Consulting, advising and ideation for proposals, the first of which was successful (NOC front end client), with more in the pipeline TBA.</li>
<li>Board and Moderator at Gnars DAO, spreading the nounish meme IRL in a domain specific environment (in collaboration with Gami).</li>
<li>Helping people onboard to Nouns DAO with lengthy discussions about the protocol and community plus how to be engaged, even without owning a Noun.</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#proof-of-concept-8" name="proof-of-concept-8"></a>Proof Of Concept</h2>
<p>One initial proof of concept in the works is NounPress, starting as a rebrand of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/popular/page/4/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">62nd most popular</a> WordPress plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/svg-support/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SVG Support</a>. This is a plugin focused on enabling site owners to use SVG formatted images within a system that doesn’t support them natively… Display Nouns in their native SVG format.</p>

<p>With nearly 1 million active users, the opportunity for eyes on the brand is immense. This will be rolled into a suite of web3-ready WordPress plugins and likely become a complete fork (hence NounPress) of the most popular CMS (used by 37% of ALL websites) on the web today.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#funding-9" name="funding-9"></a>Funding</h2>
<p><strong>Requesting 250 ETH</strong> for a six month engagement whereby:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>100 ETH deposited</strong> to a small grants like fund managed with a 2 of 5 multisig setup at nounhaus.eth</li>
<li><strong>150 ETH streamed</strong> over 6 months to remunerate operations and associated rebranding of assets</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon completion of a six month term NOUN HAUS is expected to be entirely self-sufficient in terms of operational costs and intends only to submit further proposals to Nouns for grants fund refills if and when necessary. We have every intention of applying our learnings to innovate on operational expenditure funding.</p>
<p>As pro-liferators, we look forward to our contributions speaking for themselves and trust that you’ll support this proposal. Our passion and dedication to Nouns DAO is unwavering and there’s nothing we’d rather be doing as entrepreneurs!</p>
<p>Every day,<br/>
forever.</p>

<p>I think this is an interesting / cool idea.  Like I’ve said before (and is quoted in your proposal <img alt=":nerd_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/nerd_face.png?v=12" title=":nerd_face:" width="20"/>) I think we need to do whatever we can to scale our ability to fund small asks of individual builders.  Gami, you have been in the community for a long time and been on the forefront of experimenting with the subDAO model, and you are someone who I think has a unique/differentiated viewpoint and I trust would be able to fund and help develop Nounish projects.  I had a few questions about this proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>You mention that Small Grants was formed to facilitate smaller grants, though the group has since evolved to have a fully open discretionary mandate (we’re going to change the name soon to reflect this).  Will Noun Haus have a specific mandate for things that you’d fund, or do you intend for this to be totally up to your discretion like Small Grants?  It sounds like you will focus on Nouns Builder projects (very exciting) but do you envision expanding beyond that?</li>
<li>Is this a for-profit pod or a grants program? It sounds like you’ll be doing both.  You mention you will request more grants funding in the future, but when it comes to operations/compensation funding, that will be funded by the returns you are making from investments in the future?  What are some of the ways that you plan to generate revenue?</li>

<p>Thanks very much for taking the time to share your thoughts.</p>
<p>Also, really appreciate you giving me a call over the weekend to discuss. Look forward to fielding questions during this week’s town hall as you suggested, rather than rushing this on chain (have had a few delegation offers to get me the additional Noun required for submission after Noun 400).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The evolution of Small Grants and the work you’ve done have been a huge inspiration for making this proposal.  Not to mention the fact that I got my start as a Nouns DAO contributor after having received a small grant that I passed through to Nouns Athletes.</p>
<p>NOUN HAUS intends to function in a consultative and collaborative manner with Small Grants, where we add value by filling gaps that emerge and forwarding on opportunities where relevant. We’d like to be discretionary as to not restrict the experimental nature, but have no desire to compete with Small Grants on opportunities. Extensions are where we can add the most value and our niche experience is where our passion lies – a public alliance would be paramount and I think it’s very likely our referrals would lead to more inbound opportunities for Small Grants as well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>NOUN HAUS would operate a grants program AND showcase projects we’ve built, or have contributed to (by issuing grants and providing guidance). We’d be doing both in practice, but with a clear line of demarcation, whereby we’d lead by example (as done so far) to establish potential revenue streams atop Nouns as a platform. <a href="https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Hyperstructures</a> as defined by <a href="https://twitter.com/js_horne" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Jacob</a> are in large part how we’ve been thinking about relevant business models. Open source and CC0 both present unique challenges for monetisation, but there’s opportunity aplenty.</p>
<p>There’s every chance that our experiments lead to the formation of a subDAO akin to Gnars DAO, whereby domain specificity is the enabler, but tbh that’s what we intend to find out. The chance to explore methods of self-sustenance is in part why we are so excited about this proposal. In this context, my work on Gnars DAO etc has been referenced by a number of nounish builders as inspirational and pioneering – we’ve every intention of paving a path to proliferation and guiding others toward it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>We would function in a similar way to small grants, but focusing on extensions is extremely interesting to us due to prior experience and we’re excited by projects that have a domain specific focus (eg. Gnars DAOish). The user journey begins at ideation when the formation of a sub-DAO / extension seems plausible – from validation (0) to propagation (1) to proliferation (N) – so from “how can I fund my idea” to “this should be a nouns extension” or something akin to a sub-DAO etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is nounsdao the only “LP” here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nouns DAO is the only LP at this stage since we would exist to help “proliferate” Nouns DAO in the way we’ve demonstrated, where we’d like to lean into proliferating nouns via extensions as opposed to propagating nouns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>will you be self-sustaining (ie, make profit)? and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have explored this question <a href="/t/noun-haus-an-experimental-venture-studio-for-the-nouniverse/1947/9">here in response to 22</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>corny, but where do you see the studio in 10 years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideally, we should have well and truly made ourselves obsolete by this point and NOUN HAUS should exist as something else, perhaps as an extension or sub-DAO itself. But the point here is really to amalgamate our efforts in leading by example, so we’d hope to inspire others to iterate on what we do and discover new insights from the work we’ve (hopefully) done by then.</p>
<p>Thanks again for taking the time and also for being so supportive of our work so far within the nouniverse.</p>

<p>shared some thoughts with Gami privately, sharing them here for transparency!</p>
<ul>
<li>i love the idea of a pod being spun up specifically to focus on extensions. NSFW/Small Grants funds extensions, but i leave the design space totally up to them for the most part. so i think there is an opportunity for a pod that helps with design and everything including/beyond initial funding. so i would be more favorable towards a pod with a mandate for extensions and i think we could work together on that really effectively</li>
<li>i do not love the idea of Noun Haus being a second fully discretionary grants program that could expand beyond extensions and into anything you personally think is interesting. i think this pod should be focused and you are the expert on extensions, no one understands them better than you, no one is more qualified</li>
<li>i am not clear on how this is a ‘venture studio’ and not another grants program. and that’s fine by me… i dont think NSFW/Small Grants has a monopoly on what deserves a grant (see nouncil grants, tech grants, prop house) but i would prefer this to be targeted as like ‘extension grants’</li>

<p>Thought about this more overnight and think the specific focus on extensions would be a great strength. And of course working together would be too. Essentially we’d operate like an accelerator. But also house our own projects (full transparency to help/inspire others, lead by example, etc.).</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#tldr-2" name="tldr-2"></a>TL;DR</h2>
<p><strong>NOUN HAUS</strong> is an experimental venture studio for the Nouniverse, who fund and support builders to proliferate Nouns through domain specific extensions – <em>ie. Venture Granters.</em></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" href="#background-3" name="background-3"></a>Background</h3>
<p><a href="https://nouns.wtf/vote/51">Proposal 51</a> rewarded the extremely nounish <a href="https://gnars.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gnars DAO</a> with 69 ETH to sponsor <a href="https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1546479275280584704" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns Athletes</a> after a 3 ETH <a href="/t/small-grants-nouns-athletes/731">proof of concept</a> funded by <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/nounsgrants" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NSFW</a>, which along with a myriad of other nounish experiments, informs this proposal and its approach in solving for proliferation (as opposed to propagation).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#h-0-1-n-4" name="h-0-1-n-4"></a>0 → 1 → N</h2>
<p><strong>Nouns DAO</strong> exists to facilitate a virtuous cycle of “proliferation” and yet despite our success, most of what we have funded is in fact “propagation.” This is most likely a function of first needing to occupy our own space (propagate) before we divide and conquer (proliferate).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Propagation is the multiplication or natural increase in a population while proliferation is (uncountable) the process by which an organism produces others of its kind (<a href="https://wikidiff.com/propagation/proliferation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NSFW</strong> (previously Small Grants) was originally formed to facilitate issuance of small grants. By spreading bets across a range of opportunities we’ve accelerated propagation. In many cases we’ve enabled  proliferation by funding proof of concept proposals as a “validation” step.</p>

<p>After a self inflicted Nouns-pilling in the early months of Nouns DAO’s launch, he was immediately drawn to the elegance of the protocol and shifted everything he was doing to become nounish af. About 9 months on, we’re witnessing the birth of the nounish pro-liferatooooors in a team of ultra passionate and dedicated builders.</p>
<p>What he’s been up to since diving deep into the Nouns DAO rabbit hole:</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" href="#proof-of-concept-9" name="proof-of-concept-9"></a>Proof Of Concept</h2>
<p>One initial proof of concept in the works is NounPress, starting as a rebrand of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/popular/page/4/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">62nd most popular</a> WordPress plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/svg-support/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SVG Support</a>. This is a plugin focused on enabling site owners to use SVG formatted images within a system that doesn’t support them natively.</p>
<p>ie. Nouns displayed in their native SVG format.</p>

<p>With nearly 1 million active users, the opportunity for eyes on the brand is immense. This will be rolled into a suite of Web3-ready WordPress plugins and likely become a complete fork (hence NounPress) of the most popular CMS (used by 37% of ALL websites) on the web today.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#funding-10" name="funding-10"></a>Funding</h2>
<p><strong>Requesting 250 ETH</strong> for a six month engagement whereby:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>100 ETH deposited</strong> to a small grants like fund managed with a 2 of 5 multisig setup at nounhaus.eth</li>
<li><strong>150 ETH streamed</strong> over 6 months to remunerate operations and associated rebranding of assets</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon completion of a six month term NOUN HAUS is expected to be self-sufficient in terms of operational costs and intends only to submit further proposals to Nouns for grants fund refills, if and when necessary. We have every intention of applying our learnings to innovate on operational expenditure funding.</p>
<p>As pro-liferators, we look forward to our contributions speaking for themselves and trust that you’ll support this proposal. Our passion and dedication to Nouns DAO is unwavering and there’s nothing we’d rather be doing as entrepreneurs!</p>
<p>Every day,<br/>
forever.</p>

<p>Thought alot about this and i dont think the proposal is strong enough. Id like it to be more focused and concentrated on one thing youve identified as a problem/opportunity. As it stands, feels bit wishy-washy and all over the place imo.</p>
<p>So in summary, i want you to pursue your ideas/dreams, but id rather you took this back to the drawing board and came back w a stronger and more cohesive prop.</p>

<p>I completely agree with Krel. There’s a lot to read and a lot of graphics, but I don’t quite understand the impact of the proposal.</p>
<p>Extrapolating from the example of a Wordpress plugin, it seems like this prop will simply pay coders of Chrome and Wordpress extension to add noggles to their dashboards. It’s an interesting concept, but I’m not sure the funds being request match the strength of the idea.</p>
