<a class="anchor" href="#introduction-2" name="introduction-2"></a><strong>Introduction</strong>
</h3>
<p><em>I have been thinking about how we can tell the story of Nouns to the masses and reach a global audience. I reached out to my friend Nas who I think can do an incredible job telling our story. He’s super excited to make a video about Nouns.</em></p>
<p><em>I would love to get a feedback on whether this kind of proposal would get support from the DAO.</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks!</em></p>

<a class="anchor" href="#why-nas-5" name="why-nas-5"></a>Why Nas?</h3>
<p>Aside from his massive reach, which will put Nouns on a global stage, he’s a wonderful storyteller. He has a knack for explaining complex matters in short form and in simple terms. Explaining Nouns to a wide audience can lead to a watershed moment for the DAO.</p>

<li>This is a high stake project given the viewership</li>
<li>To help make sure our story is told in the most authentic and nounish way, we can put together a subcommitee which will work with Nas to help him tell our story in the best way</li>

<p>Love this idea. We need a summary video like this and I think Nas would be an excellent person to do it. His videos always have a fun, energetic, positive vibe.</p>
<p>This video would be the first thing I send when introducing people to Nouns. One idea - in the video near the end put a call for proposals and try to drive builders to the Nouns ecosystem.</p>

<p>While I agree with the benefits of exposure and getting more builders involved, I think the quality of builders matters more. The video on SBF mostly focused on the “money” and “do good for the world” part and provided no education on crypto/finance.<br/>
I feel like there should be candidates who could unfold a complex topic (nouns rely on ETH, smart contracts, DAOs etc) in a better way - but on the flipside, they might have a much smaller audience.</p>
<p>Someone like Finematics on youtube still reaches 300k views and would be a better fit IMO. See <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xdkkux6OxfM" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">What Are NFTs and How Can They Be Used in Decentralized Finance? DEFI Explained - YouTube</a><br/>
Also <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-r2MvVdhxY" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Why Noun NFTs could rise to the top (investor guide) - YouTube</a> did a really good job back in August without any compensation (or maybe a retrofunding).</p>
<p>I think in general, organic interest from youtubers/influencers is much better suited than “paid” promotion. I would reduce the fee drastically and share it with the “committee” and see if Nas still thinks this is a good match for his audience. Generally, I believe we are too early for such a mainstream audience, and we should be more targeted.</p>

<p>I think that Nas is a great marketer and that he is really good at simplifying ideas. I enjoy watching some of his videos and I think he is one of the best “influencer” to tell the Nouns story to the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do agree with Coral that organic traffic and exposure is more powerful and efficient than paid marketing.</p>
<p>Is the end goal to raise awareness of nouns to the general public or to grow the community with people already in the crypto space?</p>
<p>What I find fascinating and innovative about the Nouns is (among other things) the involvement of the community around Nounish projects, the treasury management &amp; governance, the fact that everything is on chain, automated, open source and CC0.<br/>
Grasping the reach of these characteristics requires some background knowledge on blockchain, DAOs, NFTs, on chain governance.<br/>
This might sound arrogant but I think that the audience will only grasp one idea out of this video and miss the truly innovative aspects of the Nouns.</p>
