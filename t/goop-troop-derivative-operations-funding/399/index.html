<p>As Noun 22 mentioned on today’s call, this could be a nuanced discussion that might be worth having on discourse – there were mixed reactions.</p>
<p><strong>11/24 NounsDAO Weekly Call: Goop Troop / Derivatives Funding discussion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Goop Troop has been hitting roadblocks and needs folks being compensated to dedicate their time to the project/community</li>
<li>As a Noun owner, it’s a fine line/gray area to how we go about funding derivative projects – can see both sides</li>
<li>Dont want to make it sound like we are blessing a specific project/derivative
<ul>
<li>Would need to be extremely explicit wording if going on-chain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SharkDAO has had similar issues, would love to solve sustainable operating costs, focusing on using internal treasury funds for operational costs for now</li>
<li>Want everyone that is dedicating time to proliferating Nouns to get compensated, but also don’t want to devalue Nouns or favor any derivative projects</li>
<li>Could see funding derivative proposals that directly benefit Nouns (project/deliverables as opposed to operational funding)</li>
<li>Goop alternative funding might be selling 1 of their 2 Nouns, would provide Goop funding for awhile</li>

<p>New here ofc and I do not see the benefit of nouns per se funding Goop to do any of this. These fractionalized nouns are tricky at the moment and whoever launched the project should have the foresight to think through ongoing needs etc.</p>
<p>I’d be more interested in the nouns treasury offering a low market buyout to the nouns in Goop than funding a bailout of ongoing operations – to what end? Else, the nouns could be sold obviously. What would happen – the funds sent to the Goop NFT owners? who gets the ETH?</p>
<p>People spent a tremendous amount of funds buying, selling and gwei these items. Not sure of the tokenomics or who did what.</p>

<p>Agree, I think funding for subdaos should be for deliverables that benefit/proliferate Nouns, goopDAO is now looking at internal funding for any sort of operational / staffing costs</p>
