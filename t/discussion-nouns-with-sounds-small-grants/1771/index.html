<p>Hi everyone. I’ve recently joined Nouns DAO by way of Noun 375. I’ve been building in the NFT space since 2018 and have built various projects. One project that my partner and I built is called Audioglyphs, a collection of generative music NFTs that synthesize a unique, infinite stream of music directly in your browser at lossless quality. We want to repurpose this technology for Nouns with Sounds.</p>
<p><strong>What are Nouns with Sounds?</strong></p>
<p>Daily auctions to proliferate CC0, on-chain, generative music using an open audio format we created that allows arbitrarily high quality and length with file sizes small enough to be put on chain for a small fraction of an ETH in gas.  Noun art will interact with generative audio (head bobs, movement, etc.).</p>
<p>We intend to build this into a platform that can host independent and prominent artists. For example a week of auctions could contain a base patch from a well known artist and others could be generated from patches built by an independent artist in the web3 community.</p>
<p>25% of proceeds go Nouns DAO</p>
<p>25% of proceeds + every 10th Noun with Sound goes to Nouns with Sounds founders</p>
<p>50% of proceeds goes to Nouns with Sounds DAO to be governed by Nouns with Sounds holders</p>
<p><strong>Nouns with Sounds DAO</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the DAO is to make generative music have an impact on society similar in size to the development of recorded music and to create a new business/distribution model for music that pays artists while sharing culture with everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Existing Audioglyph Community</strong></p>
<p>We intend to delegate Nouns with Sounds to the existing Audioglyph community to participate in NwS DAO voting (e.g. SharkDAO)</p>
<p><strong>Small Grant Ask</strong></p>
<p>Reimbursement for smart contract deployment and adding initial sample data/music configuration to chain not to exceed 3 ETH.</p>

<p>hey Deployer, great chatting with you about this yesterday.  i think this is really interesting and SG would definitely cover deployment fees.  a combo of sound + nounish aesthetics is a really cool foundation for a larger platform, and the 25% proceeds going to Nouns DAO will incentive Nouns to see the project succeed</p>
<p>overall, i think the design space for Nouns forks has barely been explored and SG is here to help all kinds of experiments like this get off the ground</p>

<p>Alright I’ve updated how I am thinking about this. The trustless mechanism to swap out base patches which generate the music is new. Also rather than 25% of proceeds going directly to the Nouns DAO - it goes to a pool to buy Nouns. This gives Nouns with Sounds holders access to the Nouns DAO and we are also contributing back to Nouns.</p>
<p>Ideally could get some more funding (than potentially what small grants would allow) to start building this either through prop house, or a formal proposal (probably prop house?)</p>

<p>how much time and work would it take to get this off the ground from here?  Small Grants would be happy to fund this at the requested 3 ETH when you’re ready to launch.  what do you think?</p>

<p>I’m thinking it would take at least 80 dev hours. There would be two developers, myself and a partner. I was thinking, given that Nouns has funds, that an incentive in the 10 ETH range to build the project would not be unreasonable given a good amount of effort would go into this.</p>
