<p>Personal Message from Jennifer English</p>
<p>I am open for a continued conversation for this Proposal here in the Discourse. I look forward to hearing your thoughts….</p>
<p>Since I discovered the NOUNS DAO, I have been a passionate student of the project. The richness of this opportunity lies in the inspiration and empowerment it cultivates in the community. One immediate GOAL is to become a NOUNER and acquire my first NOUN. Presently, I HODL 3 NounBirds (<span class="hashtag">#6032</span>,7213 &amp; 7094). I am also a Founding Member of the Kitchen Nouncil of the FOODNOUNS DAO, and the Rare Pizza DAO &amp; PAGE DAO.</p>
<p>Since 1999 I have been a professional broadcaster. There is no greater privilege than to be a broadcaster entrusted with the federally licensed airwaves. This is the immediate ACCESS I am bringing to this community, and for which I am proposing to be the Steward and the Servant to the NOUNISH Community.</p>
<p>Our NOUNISH Community has established iglobal credibility and foundation. To achieve proliferation and growth, one of the most credible events happens by being broadcast via traditional media. The NOUNS DAO has proven that, in fact, ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS, but few things speak louder than NOUNS. Please allow me the honor of bringing my microphone and creating this platform to allow the NOUNS DAO to speak via Radio Broadcast to the WORLD.</p>
<p>It is also important to demonstrate to women that this community is welcoming to all and that all of our voices matter. This proposal bring a respected, credible woman’s voice to the conversation and enhances the NOUN DAO credibility that women’s Nounish voices matter.<br/>
I thank you for this opportunity and I welcome your questions, ideas and inspirations.</p>

<p>I am beyond excited to see this Proposal and to hear your vision for entering into the Nouns community with the specific talents you have.</p>
<p>As I move forward with IRL events and guerrilla marketing style activations, it has become clear that media in general is a huge commodity for the DAO. I haven’t seen Radio Broadcast in this community yet and look forward to the potential of Nouns being proliferated through radio waves.</p>
<p>You have been a pleasure every time you have joined us for Noun Square and it became very clear to everyone on your first visit that you were a professional broadcaster. Your Proposal looks great and I look forward to the community learning more about this.</p>

<p>Dear Aubtoshi, Thank you very much for your encouraging comments. I am thrilled that you “see” the potential for our collaboration with your upcoming IRL Events and activations. We were the first Nationally Syndicated broadcasters to produce “LIVE” coverage of marquee events, and I trust we will be able to do so together with Nouns on the Ground.</p>
<p>Web3 is asking all of us, no matter what our industry or expertise is, to become a “Host” to our customers and guests, both IRL and in the Metaverse.</p>
<p>In order for Future activations to be successful, they must be welcoming and hospitable. I genuinely am grateful for the privilege to be of Service to the NOUNS DAO Community, and to be a Steward and Servant to the NOUNISH Proliferation. Please let me know how I might be of service to you.</p>
<p>I am eager to meet you in person<br/>
with NOUNISH Thanks<br/>
