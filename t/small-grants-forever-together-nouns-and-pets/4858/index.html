<p>Hello, friends!</p>
<p>Based on the suggestions of my dear friends, I would like to initiate a small-scale project and, upon obtaining a positive response, proceed with a larger-scale project for voting.</p>
<p>I am certain that we can creatively expand the nouns for ever.<br/>
Our ultimate goal is to foster a strong bond between the Nouns community and large community of animal lovers.</p>
<p>To implement this project on a small scale, we require 25 Ether.<br/>
Also, we are in need of a sponsor to promote this proposal for voting. If anyone is interested in supporting this proposal, please leave a comment. Thank you.<br/>
Please visit the link below to see the project.</p>
<p>I am awaiting your response.</p>
