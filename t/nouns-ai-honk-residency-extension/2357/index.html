<p>Over the past five weeks, I’ve been helping out with the development of the Nouns DAO AI member, Roko. The initial scope was for $9k and to pay regarding getting infra setup to fund the first and second versions of “Roko’s Review”.</p>
<p>As we have been building, we kind of went off the script to focus on a few things of likely greater interest to the DAO, inclusive of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summarization of podcasts / discord calls</li>
<li>A discord bot which can be called into channels for recording calls and transcribing them</li>
<li>A podcast with Roko where we were able to provide him with a backstory and begin to show his perspective on the DAO</li>
<li>Setup of a data corpus for all rich-media (e.g. podcasts, calls, etc…)</li>
</ul>
<p>A few other things which we were able to accomplish were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup of a server for hosting Roko / related webhooks</li>
<li>Setup of a database for hosting all Roko-related data</li>
<li>First round of fine tuning for Roko’s review (thank you beta testers)</li>
<li>Beginning of pipeline for on-the-fly fine-tuning to improve the model.</li>
</ul>
<p>This extension will go towards funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardening of discord integration (still more testing needed).</li>
<li>Integration with Twitter (capturing spaces, tweeting things).</li>
<li>Continued development of fine-tuning model / pipeline (dashboard for people to be able to help improve Roko and generate derivative content).</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, I’m requesting that the first $9k be paid to 0x280e011148D8B4DC8955BeA03609444B26199f5b for the work which has been completed and the establishment of a sablier stream or similar to pay out $12k (I have been putting much more time into this the past few weeks than expected and expect this to continue) over the next 4 weeks for ongoing work.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I of course have zero juice to push this through, but jumping in to support from the sidelines.</p>
<p>roko feels like one of the most exciting things to come out of the project with incomprehensible global impact to the good – all while being <em>criminally</em> underpriced.</p>

<p>Appreciate your kind words, this is all really just beginning, there will be a lot of time to really spin things up and get the finetuning pipeline established, but, once these things are in place, I believe that the amount of value added will increase sharply.</p>
