<p>Hello fellow nounish friends, we invite you to kindly jump in on our project and give feedbacks as we discuss a more sustainable future.</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>We’ve got this super cool, earth-friendly power generator that’s right up your alley.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable energy: It’s like a mini power plant that doesn’t need fuel so saves everyone money (poverty alleviation).</li>
<li>Climate change: Releases no fumes (0 green house gas emissions) which reduces carbon foot print of individuals and industries &amp; help save our planet.</li>
<li>ROI: <i>Presents robust ROI opportunity for nouns dao treasury.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>I’m shola, founder of xolutionist. an organization thats primarily into providing solutions to IRL situations that hinder growth and advancement in all fields ranging from agriculture and technology to education and climate action in developing Communities.</p>
<p>A major problem that Africans face in all ramifications of advancement from tech to agriculture is availability of electrical power supply. In most part of Africa, alternative source of energy is the main &amp; for some, only source of power supply available. Due to high cost of renewable energy, Africans are limited to conventional energy: methods that rely on the combustion of fossil fuels to generate electricity, and these are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions affecting our climate.</p>
<p>To combat climate change, a special division of our team have for years, sought for a more cheaper means of sustainable energy that the common man can easily access and only recently discovered an engineer who’s invented an alternative power source that generates 5kva of electrical power without needing Any external propellant yet produces 0 green house gas emission.</p>
<p>Meaning cleaner air, safer homes, financial freedom from gas cost and reduction in carbon footprint for a greener eco-system.</p>
<p>This device (which will be the first of its product line) is a 5Kva generator that is able to power a single home unit that houses 2 air conditioning unit, 2 refrigerator, dish washer, heater, 2 televisions &amp; 10 led electrics bulbs all at once. It’s climate friendly, non hazardous and happens to be less costly compared to average cost of renewable energy supply that produces the equivalent of its power supply. Its Easy to operate, cost efficient and highly durable.</p>
<p>The engineer is interested in joining nouns dao and is enthusiastic of all he can contribute to the eco-system.</p>
<p>This prototype although working &amp; perfectly sound is still in its packaging stage, and in need of encasing for a polished and professional appearance.</p>
<p>Due to the newness of the technology and its open Appearance, there are little concerns with releasing images and videos of the device in its exposed state to protect its unique concept from potential intellectual property theft as its not yet patented.</p>
<p>Funds are the reason for the halt in progress of completing the device.</p>
<p>We intend to fund the engineer to finalize the completion of the 5kva generator.</p>
<p>Upon completion We intend to scale the capacity of this prototype from 5kva to 12kva and even up to 100kva to meet the higher demands of industrialist and expand its user base. This should in turn reduce the carbon footprint of more individuals and industries that rely solely on conventional/combustive energy means.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does this project impa</em>ct nouns dao upon funding this proposal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If funded, nouns dao will be the principal investor &amp; be guaranteed ROI that will go back to the community treasury. Returns will be generated from general sales of device, servicing &amp; maintenance and licensing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of our goals is to support some institutions of learning especially in under-developed communities which will give us access into their curriculum to proliferate nouns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The completion of this device will bring about a revolutionary approach to combating climate change.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide cheaper &amp; more sustainable source of energy with those with little financial power in developing communities in focus.</li>
<li>Amplify the efforts of agencies that combat climate change.</li>
<li>Generate a lasting investment opportunity for the nouns dao treasury.</li>
<li>Proliferate the shift from combustive energy means to climate friendly means of energy to combat climate change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Request :</strong></p>
<p><em>We request 4.5 eth to bring this project to fruition.</em><br/>
<em>We request 1 eth as upfront to achieve milestone 1 and upon successful completion of first milestone, further reimbursement of 3.5 eth to complete this initial project totaling @ 4.5eth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 eth: to acquire final components and bring to completion the 5kva sustainable generator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.5 eth: to fund the scaling of current device from 5kva to 12kva for industrial use and research of what it takes to scale to up to 100kva capacity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 eth: funding for legal &amp; essential measures in safeguarding intellectual property rights and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Milestone 1: 2 weeks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Videos and images showing the 5kva capacity generator in full operation.</li>
<li>Donation of 5kva prototype to the local Community higher institution where we discovered the scientist. Providing the institution with sustainable energy to aid education empowerment.</li>
<li>The proliferation of nouns into the institution curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Milestone 2: 4 weeks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Videos and images showing the 12kva-15kva capacity generator in full operation.</li>
<li>Legal protection</li>
</ul>
<p><em>This prop is a smaller part of a bigger picture where funding will be required to begin mass production and marketing where ROI will then be discussed so will require a subsequent more detailed proposal. As expected, project will eventually become self funded.</em></p>
