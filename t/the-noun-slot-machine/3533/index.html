<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>An NFT slot machine that uses Nouns as the slot images. If the user wins (winning condition is when all 3 reel slots have the same Noun image) they will get a listed Noun from floor.</p>
<p>Basically, A user pays a small fee to play and try their luck, if they win, they get an NFT. The NFT will be bought by all the funds collected from fees from past losses.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give users a chance to win a listed Noun, at a fraction of the floor price.</li>
<li>Spread the Nouns meme.</li>
<li>Provide liquidity to floor Nouns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Experience.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Token gated approach to playing ($SLOT).</li>
<li>Concepts of “Session” and “Plays”
<ul>
<li>Plays are a subset of a Session.</li>
<li>Buttons on UI : “Start session”, “End session”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Session ends automatically when a user wins.</li>
<li>User can either end the Session or keep on using their Plays.</li>
<li>Aim to make the cost of a Play = 50%+ <em>less</em> than the floor.</li>
<li>$SLOT can 2x plays, User can only use 5 $SLOT for each game (i.e. 10x max). If a user buys 2 plays and inserts 2 $SLOT they will 4x and get 8 plays.</li>
<li>When the user wins , they will be awarded the airdropped a Noun from floor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules of the Game.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To win, all the slots of the middle row of the three reels should have the same Noun image.</li>
<li>The number of slots (x) in each reel will be 5.</li>
<li>The number of winning (duplicate) Nouns in each reel (y) be 2.</li>
<li>Remaining slots in each reel will all have different Nouns.</li>
<li>The total number of configurations of the slot machine will be 5x5x5 = 125.</li>
<li>The total number of winning configurations will be 2x2x2 = 8.</li>
<li>The probability of winning will be 8/125 (6.4%), which is reasonable for the user given the lower cost of each play.</li>
<li>The Price of one Play is inversely proportional to the probability (this function is such that when y=x, then Price for a Play = Floor price).</li>
<li>Therefore, Price for one Play = (2/5) x Floor price.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>$SLOT Tokenomics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To incentivise early adoption, and get around the cold start problem - $SLOT will be introduced.</li>
<li>$SLOT will be distributed proportionally every 24 hours to users based on their number of Plays in that period (eg if there were 100 Plays and a single user played 50 times, they would receive 50% of the tokens distributed that day).</li>
<li>Fixed supply of 69,000. 1,000 tokens released every day. 69 days for all the tokens to be released (i.e for “Season 1”).</li>
<li>Only “natural Plays” (Plays that are NOT from $SLOT multipliers) count for reward of the token after 24 hours.</li>
<li>No pre-mine or team allocation of $SLOT will occur.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Timeline and Budget</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build everything outlined (2 months).</li>
<li>Tweak the algorithm to make the game fairer and more efficient (4 weeks).</li>
<li>Amount: 10 ETH</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future Possibilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate into <a href="http://nouns.wtf/">nouns.wtf</a> and/or support other collections.</li>
<li>Collected fees flow into the Treasury.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Word on Gambling</strong></p>
<p>In this game, a user can take a small risk to gain a much bigger reward. With the chances of winning being 100% transparent. I also believe that $SLOT as a mechanism, makes certain that users do not walk away empty handed. When designing the incentives we set out to make a game of chance that’s fun, rewarding and does not exploit users.</p>

<p>Interesting idea, but there is a large uncertainty by sweeping floor.<br/>
How can players be motivated to participate when they are sure that the treasury cannot afford the fp at the moment?<br/>
What if 2 winners are born in a short time but the treasury can’t afford?</p>
