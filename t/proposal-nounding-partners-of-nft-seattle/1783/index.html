<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#description-1" name="description-1"></a><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Becoming the Nounding Partners / Presenting Sponsors of NFT Seattle gives the Nouns the opportunity to build relationships with the Pacific Northwest’s Web3 community and solidify the brand in the foundation of these new relationships.</li>
<li>As we establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation, the Nouns have the opportunity to come in at the ground level and cement the brand as an integral part of Seattle’s Web3 ecosystem, positioned for maximum and lasting brand exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#what-is-nft-seattle-2" name="what-is-nft-seattle-2"></a><strong>WHAT IS NFT SEATTLE</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>NFT Seattle is the first event catering to the broader Web3 community in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, BC).</li>
<li>The vision behind NFT Seattle is to establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation &amp; connect the growing community in the Northwest. We want to unite people in Seattle to educate &amp; expose them to the opportunities &amp; possibilities that Web3 brings to creators, businesses, artists, and communities.</li>
<li>NFT Seattle will take place from 9/30/2022 - 10/1/2022 in Seattle at several venues including Block 41 and the Seattle NFT Museum.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#why-should-nouns-be-involved-why-it-matters-3" name="why-should-nouns-be-involved-why-it-matters-3"></a><strong>WHY SHOULD NOUNS BE INVOLVED &amp; WHY IT MATTERS?</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>NFT Seattle presents a unique opportunity for the Nouns to proliferate the Nouns brand and imagery (think, Noggles all over downtown Seattle) across a region that is on the cusp of a major Web3 breakout. A region that has cemented itself as a global hub for technological and cultural innovation, with everything from Amazon/Microsoft to Starbucks and many more having been birthed here.</li>
<li>As the first Web3 event in the Pacific Northwest, NFT Seattle will draw people in from Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC and will lean heavily towards education plus fostering deep, meaningful connection between brands, thought leaders and other attendees. Early data suggests the audience will be a healthy mix between the Web3 curious, and those that are pioneering in the space.</li>
<li>This event also creates a perfect opportunity for a <em>Noun O’Clock</em> IRL meetup, for Nouns that are local to the region to come together and engage with the local community while providing <em>Nouns on the Ground</em> an opportunity to execute their existing IRL events strategy, in a new untapped market. Also, by partnering with the Nounish marketing team, our hope is to ensure that this activation maximizes the proliferation of the Nouns brand and influence in the Pacific Northwest.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Nouns Branding prominently featured on Social, Website, and Emails</strong> that will be widely visible to all attendees, the public, and reviewed by various news outlets and media partners. A regional PR campaign will be commencing in the coming weeks, and the Nouns branding will be at the forefront of all marketing materials associated with the event as a title sponsor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fireside chat with a Noun</strong>, an optional speaking opportunity where a designated Noun can share a bit about how the Nouns continue to play a key role in the advancement of the overall DAO ecosystem. An example might be a deep dive into Nounder Seneca’s Prop House protocol and how this model is a giant leap forward, within the context of accelerating innovation in Web3.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#the-ask-5" name="the-ask-5"></a><strong>THE ASK</strong>
</h3>
<p>This is a title sponsorship for NFT Seattle, and cost breakdown will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$85,000 USD ~ 70 ETH (calculated at 1 ETH = $1,214.29)</p>
<ul>
<li>22 ETH - Towards venue costs + event production team (labor)</li>
<li>20 ETH - Towards A/V production + other venue related expenses</li>
<li>10 ETH - Towards PR campaign, advertising, event marketing, videographers and video editing. (This includes printing graphics for all Nouns signage and marketing materials)</li>
<li>10 ETH - Towards a co-branded satellite community event e.g., <em>“Web3 Founders Dinner presented by The Nouns”</em> or another community experience event that optimizes for brand awareness.</li>
<li>4 ETH (Optional) - Towards a Diversity Scholarship that grants event admission to select individuals from marginalized communities. Our hope is to play a small role in creating a more diverse and inclusive Web3 ecosystem, by creating opportunities for those that may not have the means to attend events like this.</li>
<li>4 ETH - Live painted Nouns inspired mural/art piece by one of our artists mentioned above (reusable at future events)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>N.B.</strong> This cost also factors in event admission for Nouns that wish to attend (up until a pre-negotiated number) as well as an optional booth activation, if there are nouns on the ground available to man it.</em></p>
