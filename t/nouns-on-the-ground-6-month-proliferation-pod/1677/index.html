<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>Nouns On The Ground requests to manage The Proliferation Pod Fund for 6 months as an important decentralized DAO marketing experiment, which includes 4 major NFT event activations.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#nouns-on-the-ground-1" name="nouns-on-the-ground-1"></a>NOUNS ON THE GROUND ⌐◧-◧</h2>
<p>Nouns On The Ground began as a conceptual idea exploring ways to bring Nouns out into the world IRL and has quickly become the foundation for an <em>experimental proliferation pod</em> within the Nouns ecosystem. With just one month of scheduling time, NounsOTG was able to plan, coordinate and complete its first multi-day activation at NFT.NYC, resulting in some planned and some unexpected exposure for the <a href="https://www.nouns.wtf">Nouns</a> brand at one of the leading industry events of the year.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#whats-next-2" name="whats-next-2"></a>WHAT’S NEXT? ⌐◐-◐</h2>
<p>More events, more proliferation and more recognition! <strong>Nouns On The Ground</strong> wants to replicate and scale the success of NFT.NYC for the Nouns, by targeting 4 other major key hubs for future Nouners and Nounish builders. To clarify, Nouns On The Ground will be working to replicate the ROI and general recognition of the NFT.NYC activation. Flexible “on the ground” event planning is an important element, keeping the process decentralized, new and always changing. The goal of <strong>The Proliferation Pod</strong> will be to create new and unique experiences catered to each event.</p>
<p><strong>The Proliferation Pod</strong> will manage the Proposal amount to cover the costs of these events. ETH funding will need to be converted to USD to cover travel costs, merch/swag orders and other event related fees. The same budget used for the NFT.NYC event, which was 6 ETH, totals to 11 ETH today to adjust for the change in ETH price since initial funding. <strong>Nouns On The Ground</strong> can replicate these activations for the same amount as previously proven in New York with a slight added cost for travel for NFT London.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#nft3-awards-august-5-7-in-los-angeles-ca-11-eth-3" name="nft3-awards-august-5-7-in-los-angeles-ca-11-eth-3"></a>NFT3 AWARDS (August 5-7) in Los Angeles, CA (11 ETH)</h3>
<p>A unique event that has started garnering attention from musicians and artists utilizing NFTs is the NFT3 Awards in Los Angeles which will have over 16,000 attendees, roughly the same size as NFT.NYC. The NFT3 Awards will be the premiere NFT summer event on the West Coast. Nouns On The Ground will immediately begin planning this next activation. This will create consistency throughout the US NFT markets, as the Nouns meme continues to spread across the world in Rio, Switzerland, Tokyo and more.</p>
<p>I will have swag and merch on hand for “ Noggle recognition awards”, multiple hidden AR POAP dispensers for event POAP collecting and of course, more stickers and buttons with 10 newly featured Nouns to hit the ground. DM if you want your Noun featured this time! I will continue to post updates in this thread as we get closer to the event.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#nft-nashville-september-1-5-in-nashville-tn-11-eth-4" name="nft-nashville-september-1-5-in-nashville-tn-11-eth-4"></a>NFT NASHVILLE (September 1-5) in Nashville, TN (11 ETH)</h3>
<p>NFT Nashville is striving to be the premiere NFT music event of the South as it brings a “festival-like” NFT event to the heart of the music capital during the Labor Day weekend. Some of the top current NFT music artists, including Sammy Ariaga, call Nashville home and have set the tone for NFT Nashville to enter the music scene with a bang. After starting through local meet-ups, NFT Nashville has quickly set a precedent for community building within this industry and the presence of the Nouns is necessary for proliferation.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#nft-london-november-6-7-in-london-united-kingdom-18-eth-5" name="nft-london-november-6-7-in-london-united-kingdom-18-eth-5"></a>NFT LONDON (November 6-7) in London, United Kingdom (18 ETH)</h3>
<p>NFT.London is being organized by the same team behind NFT.NYC, so you can already guarantee this will be one of Europe’s main NFT events of the year. With people already tweeting about grabbing tickets to this event, it is a no brainer to have Nouns fully on the ground in the UK. There is a slight increase in the funding cost for this event to account for additional travel costs.</p>

<p>Art Basel is another fantastic event for NFTs and proliferation of the Nouns Brand. Last year’s event in Miami Beach was the launchpad for some of the largest brands currently in the industry. This event is known for setting art trends and the Nouns meme needs to be logged in event attendee memories to close out the year in a strong way.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#nouns-on-the-ground-operations-costs-18-eth-7" name="nouns-on-the-ground-operations-costs-18-eth-7"></a>NOUNS ON THE GROUND OPERATIONS COSTS (18 ETH)</h3>
<p>Why choose Aubtoshi and Nouns On The Ground for these events? I have a proven successful track record with this type of proliferation and have modeled my plans for each of these 4 events after the successful New York multi-day activation. The job will get done with added elements of surprise and key events that always arise when engaging IRL. I am also involved with multiple Nounish projects that also seek to proliferate the Nouns brand and have incorporated these projects during my activations as well. The 18 ETH breaks down to 3 ETH per month for 6 months of operations costs.</p>

<p>NounsDAO funding <strong>Nouns On The Ground</strong> to operate in this fashion will allow this proven project to grow and scale without having to come to the DAO per each event. Proliferating the Nouns is the goal. I would love for NounsDAO to continue to let me show you the wonderful, creative and unexpected ways we can do just that, on the ground, IRL!</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#total-proposal-ask-69-eth-over-6-months-8" name="total-proposal-ask-69-eth-over-6-months-8"></a>TOTAL PROPOSAL ASK: 69 ETH over 6 months ⌐Ξ-Ξ</h2>
<p>Instead of having multiple proposals for each event as they come, this one proposal will cover the costs of these events planned within a 6 month period. The amount will be held in a multi-sig wallet that will release funds in the following manner:</p>
<p><strong>IMMEDIATE</strong> - Initial release for Event 1: 14 ETH (<em>11 ETH for event + 3 ETH July Operations</em>)<br/>
08/01/22 - Release for Event 2: 14 ETH (<em>11 ETH for event + 3 ETH Aug Operations</em>)<br/>
09/01/22 - Release for Oct. management/organization: 3 ETH (<em>3 ETH Sept Operations</em>)<br/>
10/01/22 - Release for Event 3: 21 ETH (<em>18 ETH for event + 3 ETH Oct Operations</em>)<br/>
11/01/22 - Release for Event 4: 14 ETH (<em>11 ETH for event + 3 ETH Nov Operations</em>)<br/>
12/01/22 - Release for Dec management/organization: 3 ETH (<em>3 ETH Dec Operations</em>)</p>
<p>There will be 3 individuals for the 2/3 multi-sig wallet to ensure transparency and proper distribution of funds on the correct date.</p>
<p>Signer 1: Aubtoshi<br/>
Signer 2: 142<br/>
Signer 3: A Nouner/Small Grants/reputable community member (DM if you feel like this is you!)</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#long-term-nounish-goals-9" name="long-term-nounish-goals-9"></a>LONG-TERM “NOUNISH” GOALS ⌐◪-◪</h2>
<p>This experimental <strong>Proliferation Pod</strong> is the next clear step for <strong>Nouns On The Ground</strong> as an appropriate scaling measure. Aubtoshi isn’t going anywhere and will continue to bring value to this community. A personal long-term goal is to be a Nouner. Until I have the opportunity to join the community as an official Nouner, I will continue to proliferate the Nouns in the most fun and effective ways that I can make possible. Thank you Nouners for giving me this chance to show you what we can do together, On The Ground!</p>

<p>An obvious hell yeah from me. Aubtoshi has proven herself to be a valuable community member through execution and consistency across all things nounish.</p>
<p>Only comment I have is considering making the ask a fixed USD amount so that the amounts needed to cover the events proposed are there regardless of market conditions.</p>

The initial experiment went so well and produced results that weren’t planned *cough cough SHOPIFY WEB3 PROMO!</p>
<p>It’s been an absolute pleasure working alongside <span class="mention">@Aubtoshi</span> and <span class="mention">@Noun142</span> with Noun O Clock and I can’t wait to see how much more can be achieved with this particular Nouns On The Ground proposal.</p>
<p>I’d also be more than happy to be that third signer if you should so choose me, I’m already on the Nouncil multi-sig and the Noun O Clock multi-sig and have carried out my expected duties as planned.</p>
<p>Good luck with this prop! And amazing work as always!</p>

<p>Thank you so much for everything you said. I am happy to have confirmed you as Signer 3. I will be making that change as well as adding the USD amount to the proposal.</p>
<p>Here is the section from the original post I am referencing. I am adding USD amounts and have made one additional change that I caught. The Sept 1st and Oct 1st payments need to swap as I need the additional month to start preparing for Event 3, NFT.London. They are on the wrong lines in the original post.</p>

<p>A couple of additional changes will be made to this Proposal prior to going on chain.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding an event (Event 1.5) in between 1 &amp; 2 and adding 11 ETH for expenses to first release as Event 1.5 happens directly after Event 1 and needs to be coordinated immediately.</li>
<li>Swap the 10/01 and 11/01 releases. I need min two months to coordinate Event 4.</li>
<li>Add 15% to the USD amount to account for volatility. Any leftover ETH will be returned to the NounsDAO.</li>

<p>Here are the changes made to the post above that will be reflected on the proposal:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IMMEDIATE</strong> - Initial release for Event 1/Event 1.5/Op: 25 ETH ($30,000 USD)</li>
<li>08/01/22 - Release for Event 2/Op: 14 ETH ($16,800 USD)</li>
<li>09/01/22 - Release for Event 3/Op: 21 ETH ($25,200 USD)</li>
<li>10/01/22 - Release for Event 4/Op: 14 ETH ($16,800 USD)</li>
<li>11/01/22 - Release for Op: 3 ETH ($3,600 USD)</li>
<li>12/01/22 - Release for Op: 3 ETH ($3,600 USD)</li>
<li><strong>Total: 80 ETH ($96,000 USD)</strong> distributed through 6 transactions over the course of 6 months (July 2022-Dec 2022) as outlined above</li>
</ul>
<p>At the suggestion made by Seneca above, we have added 15% to account for volatility:</p>
<p>-15% Increase added for volatility to 80 ETH = 12 ETH ($14,400)<br/>
-Total ETH ask including 15% increase for volatility = 92 ETH<br/>
-Total USD ask including 15% increase for volatility = $110,400 USD</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> All ETH not used strictly for reasons relating to volatility in ETH price will be sent back to the NounsDAO from the multi-sig wallet.</p>

<p><strong>LOGISTICS UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>Due to recent tournament results, the NounsEsports schedule has changed. Nouns On The Ground will be transitioning Event 1.5 budget resources into internal media production capabilities. We look forward to our first Nouns Esports events and will have the noggle stadium towels ready to wave! ⌐◨-◨</p>
<p>Nouns On The Ground has accounted for this event change and has re-allocated this portion of the budget to create an internal Media Production Pod. Nouns On The Ground will produce episodic content at IRL activations and while traveling to and from events. High quality captured content will be produced and shared on multiple social media platforms, including live streaming.</p>
<p>Nouns On The Ground will operate a “run and gun” style production, bringing hyper  flexible capabilities to all potential media creation opportunities. Production will include interviews with Nounish people “on the ground” and media content creation while at events.</p>
<p><strong>11 ETH - Reallocated Media Budget</strong><br/>
5 ETH - Media Equipment<br/>
6 ETH - Coverage Cost For The Proliferation Pod At All 4 Events</p>
<p>Nouns On The Ground is always open for collaboration. We also respect the time and budget of other media centered Nounish Proposers and Builders. This small, in-house media budget can only add to the content creation of other media driven Nounish projects.</p>
<p>All final media content will be cc0, forever, of course. We look forward to making usable Nounish content all over the US and the world!</p>

<p>I believe it aligns with NOUNS ON THE GROUND ethos; to solidify proliferation of Nouns via IRL event<br/>
And Nounish IRL events activation should aim to extend its reach globally.</p>
<p>Below is a small grant proposal that I’ve put up; a Nounish Forum in SINGAPORE.</p><aside class="quote quote-modified" data-post="3" data-topic="1733">

<p>Congratulations Nouns on the Ground</p>
<p>In my career in Fortune 50 Brand Marketing, I was involved in numerous successful activations and events. Everything in this proposal is strategic, tactical, clear, intentional and effective. It is also a source of both Noun Newsgathering and NOUNS Newsmaking and will be a valuable resource for the NOUNS Radio Network to broadcast with a NOUNIS Accent &amp; Perspective. Please let us know how we can be effective and supportive in service to this proposal. Thank you for your creative insight, activation and leadership by example.</p>

<p>Really love what Nouns OTG is doing, even though I couldn’t attend NFT NYC, the pics and montages made me FOMO just a little bit less <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" width="20"/></p>
<p>Had a wonky idea though:<br/>
Can Nouns OTG sponsor Nounish members to “represent” the DAO in various events, rather than having a few people travel the world to do this? Have a few reasons behind this…</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting more people involved decentralizes the IRL experience. Guess that’s what we all stand for eh?</li>
<li>Thinking that we can keep the core team for planning, but you don’t have to fly halfway around the globe just to attend a 1-2 day event. Basically mobilizing the international force of Nouns DAO while maintaining a certain standard of plans.</li>
<li>Saves on costs, and reduces carbon emissions as well!</li>
</ul>
<p>Any thoughts, or did I just not read carefully enough and this is already something y’all are doing?</p>

<p>Hey, thank you for taking the time to respond to this post. I love the idea of the “street team” element and have talked about this since Prop House Round 1! I recently got a channel in the <a href="https://discord.gg/nouns" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NounsDAO Discord</a>. Maybe if we move these forward thinking convos there we can start getting input from other “on the ground” type of proliferators.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> NounsOTG is requesting 5.5 ETH additional funding to add 1 event, <a href="https://devcon.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Devcon</a> in Bogota, to the Nouns On The Ground Proliferation Pod that is currently executing <a href="https://nouns.wtf/vote/110">Proposal 110</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE DOES NOUNSOTG CURRENTLY STAND?</strong></p>
<p>NounsOTG has completed 2 major events from Proposal 110, a crypto centric expo with thousands in attendance called NFT Expoverse Los Angeles, and a hackathon with a couple hundred devs hacking on the Ethereum Blockchain at ETHBerlin.</p>
<p>The first recap of Event 1: NFT Expoverse LA is live on YouTube and Can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA6tpi048Vk" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>

<p>The goal of these recaps is to provide valuable media content that allows a new audience to both crypto and the Nouns to find out information about NounsDAO and the overall web3 space. NounsOTG is all about inclusivity, genuine interest in the projects and people building on the blockchain and fun interactions to get people of all ages to participate in both long and short form video content.</p>
<p>NounsOTG will keep all recaps local to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_phF_niMXOADdx694y68w" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Youtube</a> and will continue to upload over 50+ short form interviews on the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nounsotg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NounsOTG TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>NounsOTG has two more events to finish out this prop, NFT London and Art Basel in Miami. NounsOTG will be speaking on a “nounish panel” for DAO’s at NFT London along with other nounish builders like 0xigami and CHEFFO. We are currently planning out Art Basel and possible activations we can accomplish with other builders. I look forward to finding creative ways to maximize proliferation beyond the scope of my original prop with all of the events I have been funded to go to.</p>
<p><strong>ALPHA:</strong> NounsOTG is also working with the Stoopid Buddy Prop Builders to film a “Billy In The Streets” style segment with one of the walk around Nouns being featured in the Nouns documentary and Rose Bowl parade. More info to come!</p>
<p><strong>WHY ADD ANOTHER EVENT?</strong></p>
<p>I have been approached by multiple nouners and nounish builders asking if NounsOTG will be at Devcon. It has been described as a KEY event and I feel it could be an important event to cover in the interview style that NounsOTG has been developing. Ticket or not, I can effectively proliferate Nouns at this event. I already have the merchandise I would need (extra from the last event) to be able to effectively proliferate with this short amount of time to plan.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS NECESSARY?</strong></p>
<p>At this point in time, since I have the merchandise I need, I am only requesting for funding for travel to, accommodation at and some amount for the hours spent creating content for Devcon OTG in Bogota Colombia. Each event on my Proposal was funded at a minimum of 11 ETH per event but I can fully add this event to my roster and have video/media content deliverables with the merchandise for half of that event cost at 5.5 ETH.</p>
<p>I feel like OTG cannot miss out on the opportunity to attend an event that many nouners will be attending; as well as it being a pivotal ETH event. Thank you NSFW for your consideration!</p>
