<p>Hi all, I feel there is a need for additional focus on the ideas and (potential) processes that come out of discord and weekly community calls. I would like to take on a more active role in identifying what we should go after and helping to drive those actionables.</p>
<p><strong>Funding Requested</strong><br/>
6.9E per month for 3 months</p>
<p><strong>Focus / Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attend and record notes during weekly community calls</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify and help drive actionables</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help spin up new pods &amp; processes as the DAO sees fit</p>
<ul>
<li>Due Diligence
<ul>
<li>Ongoing effort with Soli, need to explore options for increased participation (incentives?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marketing
<ul>
<li>Pitch Deck/RFP</li>
<li>Video: what is nouns dao?</li>
<li>Process for intake/prioritization and storing past/potential partners</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nouns Acquisition
<ul>
<li>Identify group and process for the DAO to start acquiring Nouns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Act as resource/poc for future proposals related to DAO operations/infrastructure during this time frame (ex: Orca’s potential proposal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poll DAO members to identify optimal time &amp; frequency for implementing a 2nd community call</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help determine consensus (<img alt=":+1:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=12" title=":+1:" width="20"/>/<img alt=":-1:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/-1.png?v=12" title=":-1:" width="20"/>) and drive actionables for opportunities coming out of discord</p>
<ul>
<li>ex: ETH Denver was brought up a couple times as something we could do, but no one ran with it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explore opportunities to increase voting/DAO participation</p>
<ul>
<li>Reimburse gas costs?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it’s a great idea to have someone be on point for operations to make sure the DAO is running smoothly. At the end of these initial 3 months, I’d love to see a retrospective and a proposal on how to scale operations for the long-term in a more decentralized way.</p>

<p>I think it is a great idea to see DAO members step up and take on residency roles where they are responsible for helping more the org forward</p>
<p>A 3 month trial is a great starting point and I think it will be clear to the rest of the DAO after 3 months if the contributor/role is pulling its weight in the DAO</p>
<p>I like this role because we have so many ideas but need someone to organize / follow up on them to get them from idea to execution</p>
