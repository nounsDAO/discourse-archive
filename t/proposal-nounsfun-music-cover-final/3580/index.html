<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We propose to create a YouTube channel for Proliferalation Nouns DAO Community, featuring music cover content. The channel will provide diverse and interesting music content for viewers, help develop the network with musicians and independent labels, establish the Nouns DAO brand as a prominent player in the NFT community, and sustain the project through Adsense revenue and brand sales. We are requesting a grant fund of 23 ETH to cover the costs of equipment, marketing and collaboration, brand development, and team compensation for 6 months…</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> YouTube is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world today, with a wide variety of content, including music. However, in the NFT community, there are only a few NFT projects that create music content on the YouTube platform. Therefore, we would like to propose a grant fund proposal to create music cover content on YouTube for the Proliferalation Nouns DAO.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The NFT community lacks a platform for music content creation, which limits the potential for community engagement and brand recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Introduce Project:</strong> We propose to create a YouTube channel for Proliferalation Nouns DAO Community, featuring music cover content. This channel will provide diverse and interesting music content for viewers, help develop the network with musicians and independent labels, establish the Nouns DAO brand as a prominent player in the NFT community, and sustain the project through Adsense revenue and brand sales.</p>

<li>Creating visual content that is characteristic of Nouns DAO, including:</li>
<li>Nouns Brand t-shirts, Lil-Nouns, Gnars, NounsDAO Brand t-shirts</li>
<li>3D printed “Noogles” as an alternative to NounsVision with a cheap version that can be purchased by prospective audiences</li>

<p>Hi Clover, thanks for tagging me in the Jungle Chat. Providing my feedback here so i dont clog that chat up:</p>
<p>You both have really great voices! Not sure why the preview here in the chat sounds so distorted and clipping… so I encourage others to click the link to hear the full video and better sound quality…! The only feedback I have from the production side is getting you guys in some noggles! :nounglassesrednoggles: Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>With that said… Is this your first video? - I think some here might like to see you do a few off these first as a proof of concept to show what type of viewership you might receive off of these videos and how far they might spread.</p>
<p>I like the idea of covers, since normies might find them, and then learn about Nouns… but not sure how this will really translate to new users entering the ecosystem just yet. Maybe some better marketing towards Nouns at the end of each video (links), in the details, etc… pushing people to subscribe, interact, etc…</p>
<p><strong>Some thing to also consider:</strong><br/>
<span class="hashtag">#1</span>. Covers can be taken down by copyright holder if they want and dont grant permission- Tho not saying they would as there are others with 600k plays on the same song.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span>. Seems like you’re kinda putting two props in one… Funding for merch + funding for the songs… I think some people might push back on this, even tho they go hand in hand.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#3</span>. I see budget for “Marketing” but dont see how you plan to utilize that eth. Is it going to be to promote the youtube videos? How far do you think that would go re: reach over 6 months?</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#4</span>. What do you plan on doing with “Independent Labels” … these are covers, eh?  Like to release a cover album or get you the rights to use these songs?</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback. It sounds like you enjoyed the video, but have some concerns about the production and marketing aspects of the project. and recommend that we release more videos as a proof of concept to gauge viewership and spread. You also suggest that we consider the potential challenges of using covers, such as the risk of copyright infringement and the potential pushback from some viewers. Additionally, you have questions about the budget for marketing and our plans for using independent labels.</p>
<p>we will edit and answer everything by completing the part you mentioned so we have a clear proposal, thank you <span class="mention">@mikegood</span> <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=12" title=":blush:" width="20"/></p>

<h2>Some Important Point Feedback :</h2>
<p><span class="hashtag-raw">#1</span>. Covers can be taken down by copyright holder if they want and dont grant permission- Tho not saying they would as there are others with 600k plays on the same song.</p>
<ul>
<li>We understand the potential risk of copyright infringement with music covers. However, we plan to obtain necessary permissions and licenses for the songs we cover to avoid any legal issues. We will also keep an eye on the copyright holder’s actions and take down the videos if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hashtag-raw">#2</span>. Seems like you’re kinda putting two props in one… Funding for merch + funding for the songs… I think some people might push back on this, even tho they go hand in hand.</p>
<ul>
<li>We understand that some people may have concerns about combining funding for merchandising and music content. However, we believe that both are essential for building the Proliferalation Nouns DAO Community brand and promoting the Nouns DAO ecosystem. The merchandising and fashion brands that we plan to create, such as Nouns Brand t-shirts and Noogles, will serve as visual representations of the Nouns DAO ecosystem and help to increase awareness and interest in the community.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hashtag-raw">#3</span>. I see budget for “Marketing” but dont see how you plan to utilize that eth. Is it going to be to promote the youtube videos? How far do you think that would go re: reach over 6 months?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the budget for marketing will be used to promote our YouTube videos and increase their reach to a wider audience. We plan to use various marketing strategies such as social media promotion, online advertisements, and networking with other musicians to increase visibility for our content. We estimate that these efforts will help to increase our reach significantly over the 6-month timeframe.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hashtag-raw">#4</span>. What do you plan on doing with “Independent Labels” … these are covers, eh? Like to release a cover album or get you the rights to use these songs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Our plan with independent labels is to network and collaborate with them to increase visibility for our content and potentially release cover albums or obtain rights to use certain songs. We believe that working with independent labels will help to increase our reach and exposure in the music industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you, <span class="mention">@mikegood</span>  for providing very impactful feedback. It is my hope that by writing on the proposal, everyone will also gain knowledge about problem-solving and solution-making.</p>
