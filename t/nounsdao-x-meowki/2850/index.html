<p>Greetings! My name is Albert, and I am 20 years old. I have had a disability since birth - I am deaf-mute person. Not so long ago I discovered NFT and Web3 and tried myself in a new role - a digital artist. Inspired by Stray and supported by an NFT media personality (he asked to temporarily withhold his name for the sake of intrigue), we created the Meowki project, which will give Web3 value to society, as well as help people with disabilities and psychological problems to find friends and gain new skills!</p>

<p>Hey there! I saw this had no comments, so I wanted to jump in and encourage your to network with a few places. Your project doesn’t directly involve Nouns, so it might be a little difficult to get traction, but your mission seems very noble, and I’d love for more people to see it. Here’s 3 things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Connect with SharkDAO. They have done all of the proposals that have been giving free glasses to kids. They are doing great work and it seems like there may be a partnership opportunity if you can connect with them and come up with something Nounish. <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discord.gg/ZtMQSA3a">SharkDAO</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prop House. There are so many houses doing funding rounds of various sorts. If you can come up with a creative way to present your ideas to some of these communities, there’s no telling what might happen. <a href="https://prop.house/">https://prop.house/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nouns Builder. I see you’re planning to do an auction style format for 99 NFTs. The builder would be a simple hands off way to try and expand that project if you wanted to turn it into a DAO and keep the auctions going in a randomized way for the long term. <a href="https://nouns.build/">https://nouns.build/</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for coming and sharing! I hope you’ll stick around and keep us all updated on the great work you’re doing. If anyone on your team can take pictures or make videos of the impact your donations are making, I’m sure it would be an inspiration to all of us. Blessings!</p>

<p>Greetings Andrew!</p>
<p>Initially, I planned to involve various NFT projects and their communities in joint online and offline charitable activities. The idea of a poker tournament to support blindness people is as follows:</p>
<p>• I’m putting together a list of projects that want to participate;<br/>
• We gather a general group chat and discuss what the buy-in will be (for example, those who want to participate from a certain community donate 5-10$ for their project’s representative). Also, if desired, projects allocate as prizes to participants NFTs from their collection, e.g. Having begun to build a structure, we together with other projects attract more people to the tournament, who, for example, are not involved in any of the participating projects, but also want to take part;<br/>
• At the end of the tournament, the winners receive their prizes, and the official representatives of the participating projects send the funds collected from the tournament to the requisites of the selected charity organisations.</p>
<p>When I started building the project in October I was sure that NFT was more than just hype and art and my ideas would be heard. I was getting support from dozens of big projects at the pre-mint stage (like they were getting WL spots, etc.), but once the project launched, all were gone. I didn’t invest the money in marketing and hype, I sent it to charity for deaf-mute children. I started sending out dozens and hundreds of affiliate offers to various projects, thinking that they would want to participate. And in the end all I get is ignores, rejections and very rarely anyone responds.</p>
<p>I don’t give up, but I have no idea what else to do to be heard and get attention <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" width="20"/>. I’m working out the details.</p>
<p>And in addition I would like to say - I am sure that the participation of various projects in what we do will increase the brand growth of these projects. Yes, it’s not a direct financial offer for the sake of hype, but NFT is about the mood of the community. And if the project community sees that its project is interested in new directions of development - this will allow the project to grow further. So far I have not been able to get these ideas across to many projects, but I am sure that a lot will change in the NFT space this year.<br/>
And among other things, I’m sure that as soon as someone famous takes part in the Meowki project - the rest will change their minds and see the prospects in what we do <img alt=":smiling_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiling_face.png?v=12" title=":smiling_face:" width="20"/></p>

<p>Greetings NounsDAO! Sorry to bother you. I hope you’re doing well!</p>
<p>At the moment, we are inviting all communities to participate in a charity poker tournament, the proceeds from which will go to support funds for visually impaired and blind people!</p>
<p>The structure is roughly as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I gather a list of projects that want to participate;</li>
<li>We have a group chat and discuss what the buy-in will be (for example, people who want to participate from a certain community donate $5-10 for a representative of their project). Also, if desired, projects allocate as prizes to participants NFT from their collection, for example. By starting to build a structure, we join with other projects to attract more people to the tournament who, for example, don’t participate in any of the participating projects, but also want to take part;</li>
<li>At the end of the tournament, the winners receive prizes, and the official representatives of the participating projects send the funds collected from the tournament to the details of the selected charities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your community would like to get involved - let me know and we’ll discuss the details further!</p>
<p>With great respect,<br/>
Albert</p>
