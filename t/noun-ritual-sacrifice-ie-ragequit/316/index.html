<p><strong>ragequit()</strong> is a consequential piece of infrastructure that DAO participants may see in a range of ways, so maybe its worthwhile to outline a simple mechanic and have a discussion:</p>
<p>the ragequit disbursement (rd) function is necessarily recursive in its simplest equitable form would look something like this:</p>
<p>rd(day+1) = rd(day) * nc(day+1) + rd(day)</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>“days” are settlement-delineated<br/>
nc = % Change to Treasury from post settlement balance to EOD<br/>
rd(day0) = Noun Auction Price<br/>
daymin (first calculation)= Noun Auction settlement day + 1<br/>
daymax (last calculation)= ‘current’ day - 1</p>
<p>this version of things evenly assigns the day’s debits/credits to the Treasury to Nouns according to their % interest in the Treasury as of that day, and then rolls that amount forward as their new disbursable value/equity exposure to the next day’s transactions.</p>
<p>notable characteristics of this calculation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provides <strong>defensibly fair (&amp; arbitrage-free) protection</strong> from a perceived DAO deviation from a participant’s interests incl. 51% attacks. Requires a fair amount of vigilance to be effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Noun’s disbursable value is  <strong>not directly diluted or enriched by future auctions</strong> or secondary market sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Noun’s disbursable value is <strong>evenly exposed to the financial consequences of DAO actions</strong> throughout their natural lives. Net credits (eg Treasury investment returns) are also disbursable in this model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outside of gas &amp; <strong>emotional distress</strong>, there are no <em>direct</em> disincentives to send this transaction. If in future certain DAO expenses were deducted immediately from Auction proceeds this would act effectively as a penalty on frivolous/intemperate bidding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not a first line of defense</strong> for vetting Proposals of subtle/dormant threats such as possible deferred liabilities to the DAO/Foundation etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Treasury balance is subjected to sudden sharp reductions</strong>, which the DAO will have to be mindful of when budgeting</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>some questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is there consensus that this is a good idea in principle?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How practically is this added as a valid Treasury interaction? To what extent can it be forked &amp; how many developer hours are needed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s an assumption of this post that the returned Noun’s would be burnt. Are there alternatives?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it desirable that fractional interest be ragequittable (possibly in exchange for suspended voting rights and a regular interest payment)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add present disbursable value (weight in ETH) to Noun profile page?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting that this never got a discourse response. Sensible.</p>
<p>What ever came of this besides <span class="mention">@verb-e</span> mentioning it in the ragequite writeup?</p>
