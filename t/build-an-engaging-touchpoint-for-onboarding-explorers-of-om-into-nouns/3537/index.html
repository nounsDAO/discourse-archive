<p>I created a home for LilNounsDAO (<a href="https://twitter.com/motiondesigneth/status/1579196169304952832?s=20&amp;t=AZ5iLmeOOEiYq2dGUh2hTg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://twitter.com/motiondesigneth/status/1579196169304952832?s=20&amp;t=AZ5iLmeOOEiYq2dGUh2hTg</a>) in Om.</p>
<p>Summary:<br/>
I think that it can act as a touchpoint for explorers of the OM metaverse to dive into the nouns ecosystem. I’d like to request 3-5 eth for this work. I am a LilNounsDAO builder and would be submitting to nounsdao using our pipeline. This would be the first proposal that I would bring to NounsDAO and I really just want to start the conversation with NounsDAO. I think this can be a fun way to start building for Nouns and I’d like to just start the conversation with NounsDAO to see if this is something you’d be interested in/get feedback on the idea.</p>
<p>Background:<br/>
I started this project as a prop house proposal and built it specifically for lilnounsdao. I want to expand on my initial build by making it an engaging touchpoint where users can learn about the noun ecosystem in a fun way.</p>
<p>Objective:<br/>
Expand and refine the current build by making it a place for explorers to have a way of learning about the Noun ecosystem.</p>
<p>Method:<br/>
As users move throughout the 3D world, they will be able to visually understand the noun ecosystem. Moving from one area of the world to another will put them in a setting that is either specific to nounsdao or noun subdao ecosystems. Positioned throughout the world will be signs that describe noun activities (such as fomonouns, nouncil, prop house).</p>
<p>Additions to the Om:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sculptures of nouns/lil nouns/food nouns/gnars nouns/public nouns/lost nouns characters throughout the world.</li>
<li>Improve texture mapping and baking materials to improve how lighting falls on surfaces.</li>
<li>Expand on the current build by adding in more noun assets making the world larger and a better place to explore.</li>
</ul>
