<p>hey guys – have a close relationship to web3 team at Instagram &amp; Meta. They’ve recently launched their digital collectible tab on Instagram (which i see as being a major step towards mass adoption of NFTs - a personal and externally accessible stage to show off your collection)</p>
<p>They had me test the feature and as it’s rolling out to all users have asked me to speak to their team to give feedback and get some perspective as a collector and member of this community. I think a relationship with that platform could be really valuable for the project – any thoughts or feedback we’d like to have me relay in the upcoming conversation?</p>
