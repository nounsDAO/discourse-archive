<p>Continuing the discussion from <a href="/t/small-grants-launching-the-npl-nouns-pickleball-league/5448">SMALL GRANTS: Launching the NPL (Nouns Pickleball League)</a>:</p>
<p>Hi all, as I’m pretty new on here and trying to be as active as possible and engage proactively I’d love some help to get this SMALL GRANT application over the line. Am I doing something wrong? Is there a process that needs to be followed? We really have a massive opportunity to take nouns mainstream, let me know…</p>

<p>I just discovered nouns today, and i could be wrong on this, but small grants are for “For Projects Needing 0.1-10Ξ” and it looks like you are proposing a 50k+ (aprox 16 ETH) startup league.</p>
<p>Regardless of not meeting that “Small Grant” definition, your proposal is quite extravagant for a first project.</p>
<p>Sorry if i sound tough, just thought you would wanna know</p>
