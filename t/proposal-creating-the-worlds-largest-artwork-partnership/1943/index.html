<p>I heard you’re in the business of investing in crazy ideas. Here’s one for you.</p>
<p>I am Future Promise, we have just put online our project aiming to create the World’s Largest Artwork.</p>
<p>It has not begun, but you can see it here: <a href="https://mdnft.co/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://mdnft.co/</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begins with a small initial artwork &amp; a countdown.</li>
<li>Once the countdown reaches zero, the artwork is complete.</li>
<li>Each addition to the artwork adds 15 minutes to the countdown.</li>
<li>Whoever adds the final piece, wins the pot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Idea of the pot is that it is incentivising the mission while building anticipation of its end.</p>
<ul>
<li>Additions to the artwork are made by users by entering prompts to an Image AI.</li>
<li>Each addition is minted by users as an NFT, providing fractional ownership of the whole artwork &amp; increasing the amount in the pot.</li>
<li>We have engineered this to scale as far as the community can take it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="ezgif.com-gif-maker (11)" class="animated" data-base62-sha1="vHnAhui7VwKcjQaimds7KCbXrqN" height="382" src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/original/2X/d/de2abf704efd1904d337dba6c80f1c4ee12fa901.gif" width="500"/></p>
<p><strong>Where Nouns comes in</strong></p>
<p>We’ve got technology, you’ve got capital. We’re proposing Nouns seeds ETH to our starting pot value, in exchange for a cut of revenue &amp; possible branding partnership.</p>
<p>There is no vague timeline, mysterious budget, or other complications. It is built. Aside from some final prep, we’re ready to go any day.</p>
<p>We would simply just put all of the ETH in our starting pot to get it started.</p>
<p>We’re happy to scale the size of the investment based on Noun community interest.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>10 ETH, 4% of Revenue</strong></li>
<li><strong>25 ETH, 10% of Revenue</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>50 ETH, 20% of Revenue</strong> &amp; nouns branding added to the page. Something along the lines of “funded by Nouns” + logo. Would drive attention &amp; similarly cool proposals to Nouns in a success outcome.<br/>
(Revenue here refers to 50% of the mint costs on this NFT collection. The other 50% adds to the pot for the winner)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>I am not one to speculate on the likelihood of viral dice rolls but let me do it anyway, 3 different outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fails/Fizzles - Nouns does not make investment back &amp; receives little attention.</li>
<li>Moderate Success (~250-500) ETH Revenue: Nouns DAO profits on investment. Large amount of attention from NFT/AI circles.</li>
<li>Moonshot Success: Project achieves r/place-like attention &amp; reaches the mainstream, Nouns - Very Large Profit &amp; Mainstream attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>If interested, I’m here for questions &amp; happy to come Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Very cool idea! I’m not sure it can really proliferate Nouns well though. It seems more that it’s trying to hedge your bet and guarantee a little profit.</p>
<p>Can’t blame you there if that’s the case, but I think it will make it hard to fund. So a couple questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does the money get into the account to start with? How does the pot increase as the art gets bigger?</li>
<li>How can it be made to be more nounish? Maybe the original art is nounish at the start along with the  accompanied site theme.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Regarding hedging our bets I think that’s a fair point. What I’d be happy to do is that Nouns would get 100% of the revenue until they made their funding back. So we wouldn’t make anything unless Nouns did. (in my opinion, I think it would be very unlikely Nouns would make a loss. Given the strength of Nouns &amp; ambitiousness of the project)</p>
<p>The pot is in a smart contract. ETH can just be transferred in at the beginning. There are mint costs for adding an addition to the artwork. 50% of that goes into the pot. It could get very large.</p>
<p><strong>Making it more nounish</strong><br/>
A number of things could be done, one is adopting a more Nouns-like theme. Here’s a quick mockup of the direction we could go in:</p>

<p>And yes! <strong>having nounish art as the original artwork</strong>. The demo has a spooky kind of art theme but we could have a more retro/cartoonish/colorful/upbeat vibe. Or some art that directly emulates noun characters. Each NFT is titled too so another opportunity there.</p>
<p>Here’s a generated example of when it starts getting larger, perhaps a thousand additions. A colorful &amp; more upbeat vibe:</p>

<p>That’s in the style of abstract paintings but adding more retro inspirations instead the starting artwork could be quite on brand.</p>
<p>Also a fun smaller detail: We have a live chat for the social collaborative aspect to play out in. Can have Nouns flair for holders</p>
<p>(fyi: Your second bulletpoint seems to have been cutoff early)</p>

<p>I love seeing the examples. I finished my second point, but you were already ahead of me on the theme idea. <img alt=":grinning:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png?v=12" title=":grinning:" width="20"/></p>
<p>Honestly, I think I’m a believer. It’s a really cool experiment. I’m assuming it’s never been done before and has very viral possibilities. Hopefully some more eyeballs get on this. I’d love to hear what <span class="mention">@noun22</span> and <span class="mention">@krel</span> think of this, but I could see it get on any Prop House radar pretty easily. On-chain would probably be more difficult, but who knows.</p>

<p>Great! I’ll continue to ideate the nouns theming.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s got the ingredients for virality, the pot/countdown mechanism designed to bring an ever-increasing momentum/anticipation as it grows. Sort of like a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/style/ludwig-ahgren-twitch-livestream.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Twitch Subathon</a>. Achieving massive scale in artworks is such a new possibility with AI, it would be exciting for people to experience.</p>
