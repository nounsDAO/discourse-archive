<p><strong>Produce temporary tattoos for proliferators to use and distribute at events.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong><br/>
I believe that Temporary Tattoos would be a great way of proliferation for the Nounish community, being distributed at events for adults and children to use, arousing people’s curiosity as well as being very fun!</p>
<p><strong>HOW?</strong><br/>
I bet you have already wanted to make a tattoo of a noggles but in the end, you always lost the courage, right? And what if I tell you it’s possible and all you need is a little bit of water?<br/>

<p>Temporary tattoos are a solution for those who still don’t want to do something definitive on their body. It will be a fun way to propagate the image of the Nounish community at crypto events like <strong>NFT NYC</strong>, but also in non-crypto events like the <strong>Carnival of Brazil.</strong></p>
<p>It can be used by adults and children, anywhere on the skin by adding just a little bit of water and to be removed, just use a little bit of hand sanitizer. The duration will depend on how the tattoo is taken care of, but on average its duration is up to 3 days. We can make a temporary tattoo with any design and text, and also with any color and shape.<br/>

<p>I intend to produce <strong>2,000 units of temporary tattoos</strong>, distribute them to some communities of the nouns ecosystem for propagation at events such as: <strong>Nouns in Rio, NounsBR, Mucho Love, Nouns On The Ground OTG,</strong> <strong>Gnars, Lil Nouns</strong>, among others.</p>
<p>And below some examples with some models that I intend to do;<br/>

<p><strong>WHO IS ILUSTRADORA?</strong><br/>
ilustradora or Dora, for those who prefer, is a Brazilian 2D digital artist whose main art style is Cartoon, focusing on character creation and design. She began in the Nounish community in mid-July 2022, participating in some art contests organized by <strong>Nouns in Rio, NounsBR, and The Noun Square</strong>. After that, she made various commissions for various members of the community, including <strong>Lil Nouns, Gnars, NounsBR, Nouns Name Service</strong>, creating PFPs, POAPs, Twitter banners, and making weekly art for the <strong>Lil Sisters Fund</strong> project since the beginning.</p>
<p>Below are a few examples;<br/>
You can follow my Twitter to get to know me better: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ilustradoraeth" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Dora’s Twitter</a><br/>
In November 2022, her proposal for the production of a <strong>Nounish Coloring Book for children</strong> was approved in the second round of the <strong>Lil Sisters Fund</strong> project.<br/>

<p>ohhhhh.  this is wonderful!  Noun22 could save a bundle by not having to cover real ones.  And… I could change my tattoo whenever I want!  I dig this! As we help local groups start up for internatioNouns, these would be great to send out to them for their first IRL events.</p>
<p>If you do this on a platform that would allow others to order them, that would be rad!</p>
<p>Have you received and tested samples?</p>

<p>Thank you sir!!</p>
<p>Yes, you will can change the local of your tattoo always you want, the design too! Amazing idea to send some packs for these local groups!</p>
<p>I don’t have samples to test because the cost to make copies is a bit high for me now (the supplier allows a minimum of <strong>50 copies</strong>). But I have some photos of temporary tattoos that stay on the skin, I got them from the supplier own website.<br/>

<p>if you make a large quantity and package them they can be stored in our warehouse eand shipped with other NOUN things we make, there are logistics costs involved but it will enable people to order lots of different things from one location</p>

<p>Thank you sir for your questions! Let’s go for parts!</p>
<p>Yes, the tattoos would be stored in <strong>Brazil</strong>, in this first moment I will send the tattoos (<em>shipping included in budget</em>) to the following communities below:</p>
<p><strong>- <a href="https://www.twitter.com/nounsinrio" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns in Rio</a> Brazil</strong><br/>
<strong>- <a href="https://www.twitter.com/aubtoshi_nft" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Aubtoshi from Nouns OTG</a> USA</strong><br/>
<strong>- <a href="https://www.twitter.com/gnars_dao" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gami from Gnars DAO</a> Australia</strong><br/>
<strong>- <a href="https://www.twitter.com/mucholovedr" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Necfas from Mucho Love</a> Dominican Republic</strong></p>
<p>For this first moment, will be a test, So these communities will have no cost.</p>
<p>After this test, I plan to have a website like a store created so that other members of the communities can place orders with custom designs of their choice for temporary tattoos. The shipping would be from Brazil.</p>
<p>Being able to have partnerships with other stores around the world, like <a href="https://bigshottoyshop.com/collections/nouns" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BigShot Klim</a> from USA!</p>
<p>I hope I have answered your questions, I am available to clarify whatever else is needed!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p><em>All the Temporary Tattoos will be produced and shipped from Brazil, so the shipping costs will be from Brazil to other countries</em></p>
<p>It depends a lot on the <strong>size</strong> and <strong>weight</strong> of the package, as well as the <strong>location</strong> it will be sent to. I researched these shipping rates only on the main carrier here in Brazil (<strong>Correios</strong>) but I believe there are several other companies such as <strong>Fedex</strong> and <strong>UPS</strong></p>
<p>For exemple, A box with 300 units of tattoos shipped from São Paulo Brazil to New York City will cost between $28 and $38 dollars. The cost varies from country to country and also the package size (CORREIOS BRAZIL) With an estimated time of 8 to 12 days.<br/>
But the deadlines and prices will depend on which country I am going to send to, a country in the European or Asian continent may be more expensive and take more time</p>

<p>I didn’t understand well sir, when you say <strong>printer</strong> do you mean the <strong>company</strong> that will produce the tattoos? I believe they don’t deliver outside of Brazilian territory. I would also need to make the packs with various designs, otherwise the person would only receive one model in large quantity.</p>

<p>got it - i am just saying i don’t know if it makes sense to pay 2 ETH to print a ton of stickers that you will distribute, instead that the art you create can be used by the printer/company that is most convenient for the buyer to use.  i believe it is very easy to get temp tattoos made at a variety of different websites, but high quality cool tattoo art is the valuable piece of this.  does that make sense?</p>

<p>Ohhh yeah, now I understood! (I think)</p>
<p>But that way people would have the cost to make the tattoos in their countries, if I just make the designs with my art the requested value in the proposal should be very decreased!<br/>
Because this way there will be no shipping or printing cost, but the printing cost would fall for the community that I mentioned above, is this correct?</p>
<p>NSFW want I just make the designs for the temporary tattoos? Sorry for I’m not understanding so well this part, sir.</p>

<p>Hello hello Sir! Hope you are great today <span class="mention">@noun22</span></p>
<p>I would like to make another request to NFSW. I would love to test this idea of Temporary Tattoos on a IRL event with many people, and as I am in Brazil and in February there will be Carnival, I am sure it would be a great opportunity to proliferate the Nouns and invite more people to learn about the project!</p>
<p>My friends from <a href="https://nounsinrio.wtf/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns in Rio</a> city of Rio de Janeiro will help with this proliferation in Carvinal! <span class="mention">@eusoujp</span> and his team are amazing people and professionals, always making great jobs for the Nouns Community.</p>
<p>So I will decrease the value of the proposal to 1.5eth, 1eth for the production and shipping of the tattoos for the Nouns in Rio team, and 0.5 for the production of the pixel and vector art that will be used.</p>
<p>I hope I was able to explain what I wanted, I am available for any doubts!</p>
<p>Thank you,<br/>
Dora</p>

<p>I can look into warehousing and distribution of these through <a href="http://nounworks.wtf">nounworks.wtf</a> we may be able to get these produced here in the us as well and have them available to ship in packs Keep in mind that there is a cost to handle this at the warehouse stage as well as shipping and internal logistics.</p>

<p>Yes, I reconsidered all the logistics involved and I believe it will be more feasible and quicker to perform the proliferation test here in Brazil during carnival, which will now be in February. So in the future, we can try in another IRL events after this experiment in Brazil!</p>

<p>How many designs are you going to produce?<br/>
Another idea would be to up a bit the ask for the art files and do something like 6-8 designs, so people can also choose which they want produced for their event/community/needs.</p>

<p>Sorry for my delay to answer you, B!!</p>
<p>My focus is proliferate the Nouns, so the most designs would be the Nouns things like Noggles and some Logos for each community.</p>
<p>But I will try to continue with the proposal in another time, because I don’t think it will be possible to the Brazilian carnival anymore <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" width="20"/></p>
