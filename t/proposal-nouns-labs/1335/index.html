<p><strong>Preface:</strong> I’m not a Nouns DAO member, so I bring this proposal as early as possible to the community members so they can help shape this proposal.</p>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#summary-1" name="summary-1"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>Nouns Labs is a working group dedicated to ideate, implement, deploy novelty approaches to the Nouns distribution model.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#abstract-2" name="abstract-2"></a>Abstract ‌</h2>
<p>Create and fund a new “Nouns Labs” working group focused on meaningful experiments in (1) mechanism for continuous dilution of supply funding a treasury &amp; (2) onchain art generation.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#motivation-3" name="motivation-3"></a>Motivation ‌</h2>
<p>Motivation <span class="hashtag">#1:</span><br/>
Nouns was a “zero to one” moment in the NFT distribution model. What does the next zero to one moment look like?</p>
<p>Motivation <span class="hashtag">#2:</span><br/>
Nouns are still largely inaccessible to the general population due to the high auction price. How do we onboard the next 1M members?</p>
<p>Motivation <span class="hashtag">#3:</span><br/>
Decreasing the auction time to decrease price doesn’t work UX-wise with the current auction model. What mechanism parameters do we tune to enable the best UX experience for buyers?</p>
<p>Motivation <span class="hashtag">#4:</span><br/>
How do nouns make sure they will keep their leadership position as innovators in the space?.</p>
<p>Motivation <span class="hashtag">#5:</span><br/>
Further, bring more exciting collaborations with fellow innovators (think partyDAO)</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#specification-overview-4" name="specification-overview-4"></a>Specification ‌ Overview ‌</h2>
<p>Working group creates a gnosis safe that receives 20 ETH from the Nouns DAO to fund the first 4 months of operations. The idea is to make this working group self-sustaining via the experiments before these funds run out.</p>
<p>Funds will be used to deliver the initial:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>grants focused on novel distributions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any in-house staff needed (Project Management, Researchers, Engineers, Artists, etc…);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R&amp;D costs (deployment, servers, tooling, etc…)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All collected ETH from the experiments will be distributed to the Nouns Lab DAO &amp; the Nouns Lab Working Group. This split is configurable by the Nouns Lab DAO that is controlled by the Nouns Lab NFT holders.</p>
<p>Every 10 Nouns created from any experiment, 1 noun will be sent directly to the Nouns DAO, forever. (0, 10, 20, 30, etc…).</p>
<p>Creation of a Yearn-like strategist performance fee. In order to directly motivate random anons to bring their new ideas to our Lab, we should give our “strategists” 5% (this value is just an idea) of the mint revenue while their experiment is ongoing.</p>
<p>All experiments much be located in a single smart contract that features updeatable distribution mechanism. This helps the user find our experiments much more easily, prevents a lot of phishing opportunities, failed experiments wont be forever forgotten 20 years from now, and we keep an historical record of all experiments we ever made.</p>
<p>Experiment <span class="hashtag">#1</span> will be using <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/gda">Continuous Gradual Dutch Auctions</a> from <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/">Paradigm</a>, targeting 1 Noun sale per minute at 0.002 ETH.</p>
<p>[mention experiment <span class="hashtag">#2</span> will be <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/01/constant-rate-issuance-sales-protocol">CRISP</a>]</p>
<p>[potential experiment <span class="hashtag">#3:</span> each “auction” is instead timed raffle, winner chosen by vrf, winner gets X Nouns while everyone else gets 1 Noun, everyone is still a winner but it adds an edge of excitement/participation]</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#rationale-5" name="rationale-5"></a>Rationale ‌</h2>
<p>Using a continuous series of auctions to distribute the NFT collection was a remarkable step in the NFT distribution model history. By constantly creating and implementing new distribution models, this proposal sets up the Nouns DAO to maintain their leadership as distribution innovators.</p>
<p>Without drastically changing the auction model, trying to onboard the next 1M+ users into the DAO will be very challenging.</p>
<p>Without drastically reducing the auction times, the entry price will always be highly prohibitive for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>If we reduce the auction time to 1 minute, assuming each 24h Noun is worth 80 ETH, we would have nouns priced at ~0.05. Unfortunately, 1 min auctions would be extremely chaotic UX wise and 0.05 ETH is still too much for the next 1M+ users to be onboarded into the Nouns ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our first experiment will be GDA auctions to solve that UX problem. It allows us to compress the price without sacrificing the UX. The nouns page will now feature a “Buy Now” button instead of the usual “Bid”.</p>
<p>Ideally, we are able to bring the best innovations that come out of this initiative back into the main Nouns distribution or any subDAOs/core groups affiliated with it(?)</p>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#tldr-9" name="tldr-9"></a>TL:DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>how much you need: 20 ETH</li>
<li>what will it be used for: bootstrap a working group dedicated to inventing/implementing novel distribution mechanisms.</li>
<li>what’s the project: Creation of sister nouns collection that will feature all the experiments within.</li>
<li>how will it proliferate nouns: (1) maintain the Nouns DAO status at the forefront of innovation.  (2) onboarding of new users into the experiments collection that we’re previously priced out.</li>

<p>Thanks for the ideas &amp; glad to have you in Nouns.</p>
<p>While in the abstract a NounsLab iteratively releasing modified forks seems like a natural enough thing (in fact a few of us started a discord server devoted to this several months ago: NIL (Nouns Incubator Lab) &amp; I reserved <span class="mention">@NounsLab</span> on twitter etc) , I think there’s a sort of naivety or even implicit cynicism wrt to the end-user as guinea pigs, etc.</p>
<p>What is the wind-down / exit-plan for the 90% of these forks that will likely fail? I think the more interesting approach is to devote real attention/energy towards a sort of Nouns 2.0 that offers a significant differentiated characteristics to the original protocol.<br/>
For example, Nouns relies on veto and it may be interesting to deploy a protocol that does not. Nouns delegation is another mechanic that can be improved. Vote stipends could be added. A reputation system could be integrated, along with security incentives such as vote stipends etc. Tokens could be freely issuable by DAO with switchable gov rights in a manner similar to Optimism’s CitizenHouse etc… An exit mechanic (ragequit) could be invaluable (esp for your stated purpose) since it would allow for healthier narrative around ‘experimentation’ in that a protocol that loses collective interest can simply be dissolved in a low-friction way.</p>
<p>Additionally think GDA/CRISP are not especially likely to be very additive to us culturally in their basic form. There’s a sense in which they will tend to fungible-ize the assets which imo moves us in the opposite direction from where we want to go.  The uniqueness of each NFT is a huge feature/strength of our space vs ERC-20 communities and AMMs that use historical price action to estimate future demand don’t feel compatible with this ethos to me, unless the thing being sold is a mintpass which allows further downstream customization.</p>
<p>Anyway, just some stream of consciousness feedback…the dao definitely will benefit from more ppl thinking about protocol mechanics from different perspectives, so I do encourage you to keep pursuing the ideas that inspire you. that said, not sure i would support 50 eth going to this pod if the focus is on the paradigm amms. Actually, come to think of it a simple tweak of Nouns implementing RICKS (another paradigm concept) could be quite interesting. The structural shift from programmatic dilution to programmatic turnover imo could be fascinating to see unfold.</p>

</aside>
<p>As stated in the post (as a TODO), the idea is to create a single fork that is constantly plugging in new distribution mechanisms.<br/>
This leaves us with a single contract that represents all historical experiments.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re all guinea pigs in this space.</p>
<p>All of the changes you recommend are def on our list of experiments (specially changing from comp style dao to moloch v3 with ragequit)</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ll update the proposal to clarify this. Besides inovating on the distribution side we also want to inovate on the art/visual side. These novel distribution mechanism don’t dillute the non fungibility imo.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is a highly reductive description of what we’re trying to do here. We’re trying to build something that’s more than just implementing paradigm papers.</p>
<p>If the 50ETH is too much to bootstrap this initiative, I’m sure we can find a more feasible number.</p>

<p>Hey team I love the idea of more rapid exploration of mechanism/product. Few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the benefit of having a single nounsdao fork w/ upgradeable distribution vs one nounsdao fork for each new mechanism?</li>
<li>Are you focused specifically on the distribution mechanisms or also interested in exploring new models for the art pipeline, utility of the nfts, dao treasury allocation mechanisms, etc.?</li>
<li>Will you take a founders reward on the forks as well or is the idea that the grant will be the sole source of funding?</li>
<li>Have you thought about experimenting with a lower cost network than Eth L1?</li>
<li>Will you invest in making it easy for others to re-use implementations that come out of the lab? (e.g. prioritize open sourcing and documenting the implementations)</li>
