<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pqcQHj74JYg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Listen to the Chorus</a></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br/>
We were supported by small grants to deliver the Nounga for the first 300 Nouns and the webpage (here is is: <a href="http://www.Nounga.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nounga.wtf</a>). We’re asking for further support to pioneer cc0 music, build out the fun and bring a new cultural element to the Nouns ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Why Music?</strong><br/>
Music is at the heart of all cultures. The Nouns are creating a new culture that is marked by a fun and playful vibe. So far, the culture is heavily visual, and we want to start layering in music as an important element in proliferating the Nouns. Think about the opening theme of the Olympics, the opening to a favorite TV Show, and the various jingles throughout the world that each culture knows in an instant. You know the who and the what in seconds. We think “The Nounga” song represents the fun and playful vibe of the Nouns, and results in one of the first responses we got when we released the Nounga on Twitter,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now, I’m going to have the Nounga in my head all day!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>As Nouns daily media develops (Nouns News, Nounsquare etc) we’ll need more music to support. On the Nounsquare, sounds play an important role, we think the Nounga could fit into the mix there, part of an intro or outro, maybe a Friday night signal for the weekend. The Nouniversary is upcoming. How will we celebrate across Twitter? The Nounga could play a fun and catchy role.</p>
<p><strong>Leading the way with cc0 Music</strong><br/>
Importantly, the song will be cc0. This will continue to allow the Nouns to blaze a trail with cc0 projects. No more licensing and use issues for a song. Play it behind any meme or project. We’d love to hear it anywhere there is nounishness. Perhaps it makes it to an IRL gathering at NFT NYC or London. This will open a path for more cc0 music in the Noun culture and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping the fun going</strong><br/>
So, along with the music we will complete the Nounga with every Noun up to the Nouniversary. We will animate the Nouns to dance to the song. This will create a website, animation, and song that can be used to celebrate the Nouniversary and well beyond.</p>
<p><strong>How we’ll do it</strong><br/>
The song will be created by SoundsofNounsGuy, with music and production from NateFox. We have a first draft of the chorus <a href="https://youtu.be/pqcQHj74JYg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Listen to the Chorus</a></p>
<p>"Oh the Nounga<br/>
It’s growing lounga<br/>
Every Noun in the club tonight<br/>
Come join in on the Nounga line<br/>
Oh the Nounga<br/>
It’s getting strounga<br/>
Every Noun in the club tonight<br/>
Come join in on the Nounga lines "</p>
<p>We will be crowd sourcing some of the lyrics in twitter and the discord which will augment SoundsofNounsGuy’s rich stream of ideas, and start to proliferate the idea in the community.</p>
<p>Website developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The song on the site <a href="http://www.Nounga.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nounga.wtf</a></li>
<li>All Nouns up to the Nouniversary (that’s what we’re calling 1yr of Nouns right?) added to the Nounga.</li>
<li>New backgrounds: Nightclub, warm, and 1 more as voted by the community.</li>
<li>‘Play’ animation which has the Nouns moving in-time  to the music as they scroll across the screen</li>
<li>Search button for a particular Noun eg <a href="http://www.nounga.wtf/?noun=22" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a search for 22 would produce this result</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Jawshua Fisher is creative consultant, and will be getting the song onto traditional digital platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)</p>

<p>This has now been funded by LilNouns (with the inclusion of some LilNounish lyrics in the mix). Thanks for all your interest.</p>
<p>Great to see the wider eco-system at play.</p>
