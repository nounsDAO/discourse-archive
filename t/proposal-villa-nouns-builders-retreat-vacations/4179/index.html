<h2><a class="anchor" href="#summary-2" name="summary-2"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>We plan to transform a villa in Costa Smeralda, Italy into the ultimate nounish destination.</p>
<p>The villa will showcase NFT art, projects, and experiences related to Nouns, and will serve two primary purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nouns Vacations: By offering the villa as a high-end, Nouns-branded vacation rental that highlights NFT art and experiences from the Nouns ecosystem, we create a unique experience for guests and visitors while promoting the Nouns brand.</li>
<li>Builders Retreat: As a gathering place for digital artists, developers, and creatives within the Nouns ecosystem, the villa will facilitate collaboration, networking, and skill-sharing, while leading to the creation of Nouns-related projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The villa is already built and accommodates guests year-round, with peak activity during the summer season. We aim to complete the project within 8-12 weeks from the proposal’s approval date, so to host the first guests from May 2023 and builders from October of the same year.</p>
<p>The initiative is led by the property owner, a real estate developer with decades of experience in the industry. Collaborations will be formed with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nouns-related projects: to showcase their initiatives and creations to visitors of Villa Nouns;</li>
<li>Prop House: to host weekly rounds rewarding the top applicant with a 1-week retreat at Villa Nouns;</li>
<li><a href="https://dlabs.app" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">dlabs</a>: to oversee development of website, smart contract for Villa Nouns NFT collection, on-chain bookings and on-site interactive experience;</li>
<li>[TBD] The Noun Square / speaker: to host virtual events for projects made during builders retreats;</li>
<li>[TBD] Architects and designers studio: involved in the villa redesign;</li>
<li>[TBD] Video makers: to create promotional material;</li>
<li>Locals: to offer recreational activities for builders and guests, while onboarding them to the Nouns ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Future plans include extending the concept to additional villas and properties (restaurants, recreational areas) which will be built and designed with the Nouns concept in mind from the start. Ultimately, we envision establishing the first Nouns Resort and expanding to other locations worldwide.</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#nouns-vacations-3" name="nouns-vacations-3"></a>Nouns vacations</h2>
<p>From April to October, Villa Nouns becomes a one-of-a-kind vacation experience, immersing guests into the captivating world of Nouns.</p>
<p>Visitors at the villa will encounter references to numerous Nouns projects, past and future, seamlessly integrated with the surrounding natural environment. Guests will be able to read the Nouns comic, ride Gnars skateboards, watch the Nouns movie, explore the history of Nouns on interactive screens, and more. Furthermore, holders of Nouns and derivative NFTs will enjoy an even more personalised experience.</p>
<p><strong>Booking and check-in</strong></p>
<p>Guests will be able to book the villa on <a href="http://villanouns.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">villanouns.com</a>, offering an Airbnb-like experience with on-chain payments in ETH / USDC or other ERC20 tokens.</p>
<p>Upon purchase, buyers will also receive “Villa Nouns” NFTs, a Nouns-derivative collection with a supply growing by up to 1 unit per day. Payments will be processed through a decentralised store on the <a href="https://slice.so" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Slice protocol</a>.</p>
<p>To check-in, buyers will unlock the smart lock and gain access to the villa by verifying their on-chain purchase. Other wallets can also be appointed by the buyer to unlock the villa using delegate.cash.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Revenues</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Rental income: Generating revenue through rental fees from guests staying at Villa Nouns.</li>
<li>Physical and NFT sales: Offering guests the opportunity to purchase NFT art or objects showcased at the villa.</li>
<li>Partnerships and collaborations: Working with local businesses or other brands within the NFT space to create exclusive experiences for guests.</li>
</ol>
<p>15% of profits will be reinvested into the nouns treasury by purchasing Nouns NFTs.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits to the Nouns Ecosystem</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Enhanced brand exposure: Offering a Nouns-themed vacation experience will introduce the Nouns brand to new audiences.</li>
<li>Immersive IRL experience: Catering to the growing demand for unique, noun-inspired in-person experiences, the vacation rental will offer an interactive and immersive environment that brings the Nouns brand to life for guests.</li>
<li>Community engagement: Encouraging Nouns community members to visit and experience the villa will help strengthen the community and foster a sense of belonging.</li>
<li>Revenue generation: Rental income, NFT sales, and partnerships generate revenue that  is reinvested into the Nouns ecosystem to support further growth and development.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h2><a class="anchor" href="#builders-retreat-4" name="builders-retreat-4"></a>Builders Retreat</h2>
<p>From October to April, Villa Nouns will bring together talented artists, developers, and other creative professionals for an immersive experience at the Builders Retreat.</p>
<p>By providing an environment that encourages networking and creative exploration, the retreat will act as a catalyst for innovation, inspiring the creation of original nounish projects.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Foster collaboration: Create an environment where participants work together on innovative art projects, applications, experiences or NFT collections based on Nouns.</li>
<li>Skill-sharing: Facilitate workshops and discussions led by Nouns veterans and industry experts to help participants expand their knowledge and maximise their chances of success.</li>
<li>Networking: Bring together creators from diverse backgrounds to build long-lasting relationships and connections with the web3 and Nouns communities.</li>
<li>Showcase projects: Organise virtual events at the end of the retreat to highlight the projects created, drawing attention to the Nouns ecosystem.</li>
<li>Nurture sense of belonging: Cultivate a supportive and inclusive atmosphere, developing a sense of community among participants.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The weekly retreat</strong></p>
<p>Each week builders will present their ideas in a Prop House round, with the most voted idea being awarded a free one-week stay at Villa Nouns. Their only commitment is to work on the project and showcase the outcome of their efforts at the end of the retreat.</p>
<p>Players in the nouns ecosystem will be encouraged to support creators during that week, either with their connections or specific skillset.</p>
<p>A half-day excursion will be organised for attendees to discover the local area, foster bonding among them, create lasting memories, and unwind from the intensive creative sessions.</p>
<p>At the end of each weekly retreat, builders will present their project in a virtual event to Nouns and the broader web3 communities, while sharing the highlights from their experience at Villa Nouns.</p>
<p><strong>Expected Revenues</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Sponsorships and partnerships: Collaboration with industry-leading protocols and platforms can generate additional revenue through sponsored virtual events or branded experiences in the villa.</li>
<li>NFT sales and auctions: Projects developed during the retreat will be encouraged to give back part of their profits into Villa Nouns or Nouns DAO, in exchange for ongoing support.</li>
</ol>
