<p><strong>PROJECT DETAILS</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a Nouns sailing boat, named as “Nouns Sailor” with custom sails, and customized interior cruising and stopping in each city with a lot of people seeing a sail with the glasses of nouns coming in…</p>
<p>Imagine the boat participating on the big nautical events in the country, Big medias, Charters, sailing classes, and all the interior customized for Nouns, a real boat for noun’s culture.</p>
<p>The nautical community is so big in our country, so connected and supportive with the media these days. We see each other constantly by the sea, and especially at the marinas, if you have a sailboat, you are a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Base Location</strong></p>
<p>In Brazil we have the culture to go to the beach constantly, vacations, holidays, weekends, if we have an opportunity, we go find the ocean to have some peace. On these occasions, I’ll offer rental charters and sailing classes, everybody will see the Nouns customized boat and learn about it.</p>
<p>I live in Búzios, Rio de Janeiro, the city will be the base for the boat, and all the cruising will go from here, is a good location, TOP 5 INTERNATIONAL TOURISM IN BRAZIL. Just in New year’s week, Búzios receive more than 300 thousand tourist, and our summer is more than 3 month, its start in December and ends in march after the carnival, 1,5 million tourist all around the world come visit Búzios during the summer.<br/>

<p>Hey Ricky! Great stuff. Sailing is definitely nounish, and as a keen sailor myself I love the idea of nouns boats around the world.<br/>
I will just say that I feel that the ETH ask is quite large compared to the proliferation factor. You might want to think of Nouns as a “sponsor” rather than a fund to build a relatively unrelated business - even though it will be dressed with nouns, it can function without it. Maybe try and find more ways to relate it to the nouns project on top of sails and hulls having stickers.<br/>
I love the idea but I think the proposal needs a bit more work. You should keep on, maybe work with a designer to create some photoshop work that would make us dream. For example I would love to see the hull covered with this:<br/>

<p>Hey, Thanks for the Feedback!<br/>
I’m a Skipper, but work on other’s boat, don’t have my own yet. Yes, I know the amount is quite large, that is just because of the boat, for the project to happen I need the sponsoring for buying the boat and than the rest can happen.</p>
<p>But, shure! About the desing, doing some nice art on the Hull and sails (this art in particular it would be amazing) I can managed to have some good designer friend helping me with the art.<br/>
I’ll Try to work more to show that having the boat I can travel and expand the nouns in Brazil.<br/>
The Event That I would be in have a lot of potential people to be in Nouns world.</p>

<p>I like the idea, but you’re going to run into inevitable comparisons with this prop:</p>

<p>They did 5 boats in Korea for 25ETH when ETH was significantly lower than it is now. I don’t think the DAO is going to want to own a boat, so this ask will come across as ‘Nouns buys me a boat and I thank them by putting noggles on the sail’, which will be difficult to get through.</p>
<p>This has good proliferation potential just like the other one, but I think you’ll need to find a boat to nounify rather than buying one outright. One man’s opinion.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<p>Yes, I understand. But if I had a boat for my self I wouldn’t go in all those event, like Rio Boat show or Sailing week, but for the project is super vailable to disseminate the nouns culture, to much people in it.</p>
<p>I tried partnerships first, with ho had a boat, but is dificult have a good impact just givind sails customized and they have already their own agenda, with the project going on, a lot of people would be interested.</p>
<p>All those event, and traveling for more than a year to disseminate the culture at the best events is how I’m going work. The customized boat and sails is just detail for what I can achive with this, bu I know it is hard to pass the ideia with the price to high for the boat, I was afraid that would hapenned.</p>
<p>I’m reforming the proposal to be more nounish already with some feedbacks that I had.</p>
<p>I saw the Korea Project, amazing the Ideia.</p>
<p>I’m just waiting for a partnership to happen to have a better proposal.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feed back  apreciate it</p>

<p>Just for you all to know.</p>
<p>I team up with a partner to get this project better, reform the Idea, and be really useful for the comunity of Nouns DAO</p>
<p>We are reforming everything to get the price asking for the project to be really lower than this one,</p>
<p>Just a little more patience, in a week or two we will post again here for feedback!</p>

<p>Agree. This prop would come across as NounsDAO buying you <span class="mention">@Rickyday</span> a boat for you to sail around in it. Like <span class="mention">@AndrewLaddusaw</span> suggested, maybe you can find/rent a boat or organize a sailing trip like what was done in Korea.</p>

<p>Yes, that why I’m doing some changes and new research for the new proposal. The boat is not the principal, but what can achieve with it.</p>
<p>When I posted I will send here the link.</p>
