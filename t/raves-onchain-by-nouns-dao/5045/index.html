<p>Hey everyone, I’m right now on the hunt for some funding for an idea that I’ve already executed on in the past and now want to bring over into the crypto space and the USA… Lowkey, most of the parties in the crypto space are wack because they’re half-assed and poorly executed… And never about the art or the fun but just about the status… I want to change that up and show people what good music is and what an amazing partying experience can be like when there is no hierarchy…</p>
<p>So here is my proposal and I want to hear some feedback and also if someone wants to point me in the right direction of getting this sponsored - since I’m not a DAO Noun holder. If you have any questions feel free to ask them!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Raves OnChain by Nouns DAO</p>
<p><strong>What do I want to do?</strong><br/>
I want to convert a step van into the ultimate mobile DJ booth and streaming studio. Think a high-tech food truck that has a DJ booth instead of a line cook. Then I want to travel through the US, visit crypto events, and do pop-up shows with local music scenes and producers/DJs/Artists at these locations.</p>
<p><strong>Why Nouns?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I think the aesthetic would be killer - I want the DJ playing out of the Nouns glasses as the people party in front.</li>
<li>but most importantly, instead of me running around and aggregating various crypto sponsors, I want to see what the Nouns community says. Usually, when I collaborate with multiple sponsors, they all want to give their 2 cents - which always negatively impacts the end result due to compromising.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why me?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve built a mobile DJ booth/recording studio out in Europe before (<a href="https://youtu.be/QFTYiXOdAT4" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/QFTYiXOdAT4</a>).</li>
<li>I’ve built an online music channel that grew from 0 to 60k monthly listeners.</li>
<li>I have a network of over 400 artists/producers/DJs from across the globe.</li>
<li>I’ve organized over 100 music events in my life.</li>
<li>This is my fun - Music, Crypto, DIY, and Events!</li>
<li>I have a well-paying and likable job so I won’t be greedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>End Goal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Record over 100 performances and upload them to all available streaming platforms at the time of the distribution.</li>
<li>Attend 5 various crypto conferences with the Bus 2024</li>
<li>Organize 5 events</li>
<li>Organize 10 guerilla-pop-up events.</li>
<li>Work with 10 non-web3 record labels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>—Timeline—</strong></p>

<p><strong>Phase 2, the traveling from May till March</strong></p>

The best things in life are worth waiting for and either you take from something that has already been made or you create something entirely new. 
This proposal is to introduce the ever growing Nouns community to the world of owning premium spirits in your Nft investment portfolio without leaving your front door and, to introduce the world of whisky to Nouns. Our first Nouns DAO offering will be to create and craft a premium, 3-year o…

<p>What should I focus on when pitching such a financially heavy proposal? Is ROI important in regard to brand recognition? What are the things we’re looking to achieve?</p>
