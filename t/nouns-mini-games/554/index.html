<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a long time gamer and lover of the Nouns concept. I’ve been lurking for a while and thinking how I could help to spread the Nouns vision. I unfortunately don’t have the eth to buy a noun, but still would like to contribute to the community in ways I can.</p>
<p>To let more peeps know about nouns, I decided to create mini-games; starting with: nounsjump. It’s a simple, yet addictive game and can be played on OpenSea! It works on mobile or desktop / laptop devices. You just jump, earn score, share it, and have some fun. I believe Nouns are the perfect characters for mini-games like this one, they are cute, playful and fun to play with.</p>
<p><strong>Plan:</strong><br/>
If the project succeeds, I’d like to bid on and win a noun auction, then participate actively in votings of the Nouns DAO. All other revenue - minting and opensea fees - from the game(s) will go to the treasury.</p>
<p>No funding is needed as I am doing this as a hobby and it is an honor create something for the Nouns community. Also it is an experiment to see if its worth creating games that can be played directly on OpenSea.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for reading and hope you’ll like the games!</p>
