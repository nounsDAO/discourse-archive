<a class="anchor" href="#abstract-1" name="abstract-1"></a>Abstract</h1>
<p>In the bear market it might not make sense for DAO treasury to sell off their ETH, the alternative would be to get a stablecoin line of credit from the community, to be used when needed and repaid when needed.</p>
<p>TrueFI DAO has built an <strong>infrastructure for DAOs to be able to get Lines of Credit from their communities</strong>.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This idea is <strong>NOT</strong> LOOKING FOR FUNDING from NounsDAO.</p>
<h1>
<a class="anchor" href="#overview-2" name="overview-2"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>Lines of Credit by TrueFi DAOs are fully on-chain, non-custodial mechanism for creation of reputation based credit lines. TrueFi DAO is looking for a decentralized, on-chain, credible partner to whitelist for a deployment of this product.</p>
<p>Below you can find detailed description on how the protocol works.<br/>

<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#collateral-requirements-4" name="collateral-requirements-4"></a>Collateral requirements</h2>
<p>There is <strong>no collateral requirements</strong>. This product is solely based on on-chain reputation of the NounsDAO and its community. Lenders are aware of this and are making an informed choice. NounsDAO, when defining the “yield curve” takes this into consideration.</p>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#how-this-would-work-5" name="how-this-would-work-5"></a>How this would work?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On positive feedback from the community, TrueFi DAO votes on a proposal to whitelist NounsDAO address as an eligible line of credit deployer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NounsDAO votes to deploy (e.g.) 3 year term line of credit on TrueFi Protocol, defining own yield curve of choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NounsDAO is NOT paying for being able to have this Line of Credit, and not paying any interests until the separate vote to trigger borrow happens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NounsDAO votes to borrow an amount from the pool of funds deposited by LPs. Interests are being paid <em>only</em> from the amount borrowed at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NounsDAO votes to repay an amount back into the pools at any time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 3 years Nouns DAO promises to repay all the outstanding principles and interests - borrowing and depositing into the Line of Credit are disabled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
