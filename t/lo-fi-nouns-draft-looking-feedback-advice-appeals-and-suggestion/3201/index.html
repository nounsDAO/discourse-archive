<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : Lo-Fi Art and Music Production, Non-Stop Live Streaming</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Lo-Fi is a type of music that brings a calm atmosphere because it contains natural sounds that we often encounter in our daily life, such as raindrops, the friction between the glass and the lid, the whispers of people while talking, and so on. The tone or rhythm used in Lo-Fi is usually repeated and the duration of the song is quite short. It is natural sounds that are used to support Lo-Fi music to be more colorful. Until now Lo-Fi music continues to grow and many other types of songs are changed to the Lo-Fi version to get the calm atmosphere that only Lo-Fi has. Initially Lo-Fi hit again through the SoundCloud music platform, but now we can listen to Lo-Fi music through other platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, and music streaming websites such as Chillhop and TuneIn.</p>
<p>The calm aura generated by Lo-Fi is generally used by teenagers or those who want to be more focused when doing something. Lo-Fi music can be the right choice to accompany us while studying at home. Not only does it help us focus more, Lo-Fi can also help us feel more relaxed. Usually Lo-Fi music playlists are arranged based on a certain theme or atmosphere, for example for studying, meditation, morning mood, and so on. We can adjust the existing playlist options to our needs and moods. Therefore the key to always be enthusiastic about studying at home is to prepare a positive mood and place to study and maintain health so that the body condition remains fit.</p>

<p>Lofi Girl YouTube channel was created on March 18, 2015.<br/>
Since last year, Lofi Girl has grown rapidly and now has 11 million subscribers. The YouTube channel has 354 videos since they started, and currently Lofi Girl has 43.8k - 7m weekly average views, with a total of 1.4B views, With an estimated monthly earnings of $50,000-$115,000.</p>
<p><strong>Behind the fame of lo-fi</strong></p>
<p>In the midst of a busy schedule, people often feel tired or stressed. This encourages them to seek entertainment to calm down. One popular choice is listening to music, and lo-fi music is often considered. Many people have commented positively that lo-fi music improves concentration, Therefore, it is not surprising that the lo-fi music covers used are vector art or pictures of someone studying. Lo-fi music is also often used to just enjoy me-time, so it is no wonder that this song is in great demand among young people. With its low radio-quality sound and largely devoid of lyrics, many people listen to it when they are too bored or bored with other mainstream songs.</p>
<p><strong>Why is lo-fi music an option?</strong></p>
<p>Lo-Fi music is a fresh and modern alternative for those looking for calming and relaxing music. While classical music can also be used as a calming background sound, it does not always adhere to a slow tempo, nor is it accepted by everyone due to personal taste. Ultimately, everyone’s preferences should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p><strong>Lo-Fi Music Is huge market?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, lo-fi music is becoming increasingly popular. People are beginning to appreciate its laid back and soulful feel, making it a great choice for relaxation or a pleasant background ambiance, The exact market size for lo-fi music is difficult to estimate, as it includes many different genres and subgenres. However, research shows that lo-fi music has been gaining traction and is estimated to be worth millions of dollars a year in terms of revenue.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#some-information-points-relate-to-this-prop-1" name="some-information-points-relate-to-this-prop-1"></a>Some Information Points Relate To This Prop</h1>
<p><strong>Cost Production Music</strong></p>
<p>The cost of production music can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the length of the track, the type of license you need, and the specific music library or composer you are working with. In general, though, you can expect to pay anywhere from a few dollars for a short, basic track to several hundred dollars or more for a longer, more complex composition.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Making Loop Animation</strong></p>
<p>The cost of creating a loop animation in a studio with 4k quality can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the length of the animation, the complexity of the visuals, and the specific studio you are working with. In general, though, you can expect to pay anywhere from a few hundred dollars for a short, simple animation to several thousand dollars or more for a longer, more complex piece.</p>
<p><strong>Loop Animation Lo-Fi not Serious Needed, Because the audience will only enjoy Lo-Fi music?</strong></p>
<p>The impact of content visualization in the entertainment industry</p>
<p>Content visualization can have a significant impact in the entertainment industry. Effective visualization can increase audience interest and enhance the appeal of an entertainment product. This is because visualization can help to express ideas and stories more clearly and engagingly.</p>
<p>In addition, visualization can also help to convey messages and values that are intended to be conveyed in an entertainment product. For example, through the use of appropriate symbols, visualization can help to convey messages about love, friendship, or tolerance in a movie.</p>
<p>Overall, content visualization is crucial in the entertainment industry because it can help to increase audience interest, build a suitable atmosphere, and convey messages and values that are intended to be conveyed.</p>
<p><strong>Why This Project large budget needed?</strong></p>
<p>A large budget in a project is typically considered important because it can help to ensure that the project is completed well and on time. With a sufficient budget, the project can hire sufficient staff and provide the necessary equipment and technology to achieve the project’s goals.</p>
<p>In addition, a large budget can also help to reduce the risk of project failure. For example, if technical difficulties or failures arise, a large budget can be used to address these issues so that the project can still be completed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a large budget can also help to improve the quality of the final project outcome. For example, with a sufficient budget, the project can hire more experienced staff and use more advanced equipment and technology, resulting in a better final project outcome.</p>
<p>Overall, a large budget in a project is considered important because it can help to ensure that the project is completed well, reduce the risk of failure, and improve the quality of the final outcome</p>
<p><strong>Youtube Content concept</strong></p>
<p>YouTube Lo-Fi Nouns conceptually portrays the use of Lo-Fi music as a background for videos on YouTube. Lo-Fi is a genre of music that emphasizes rough and imperfect sounds, often used to create a relaxed and tranquil atmosphere. YouTube Lo-Fi Nouns videos will feature nouns engaging in everyday activities like reading, writing, or enjoying nature, all played against a Lo-Fi music background that makes them feel more comfortable and relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>Creative process of making Lo-Fi music</strong></p>
<p>The creative process of making Lo-Fi music varies depending on individual needs and preferences, but there are some common steps that are often taken. First, choosing the type of instrument or sound to be used, which usually includes guitar, keyboard, sample, or natural sounds. Then, finding or creating samples and sound effects that match the desired Lo-Fi genre, such as reverb, delay, or distortion. After that, arranging the music by combining the selected samples and sound effects, adding desired instruments, and adjusting the volume and sound effects levels to achieve the desired atmosphere. This process is usually done iteratively, constantly changing and refining the musical arrangement until satisfied with the result.</p>

<p>I know we chatted about this a bit already, but I wanted to share two questions to ponder.</p>
<p>How will this proliferate Nouns? What benefit will this provide to the DAO and it’s many communities?</p>
<p>I had never listened to lo-fi before we talked about it a few days ago, but I’ve been listening every night since. You’ve made a believer out of me. <img alt=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12" title=":sweat_smile:" width="20"/></p>
<p>I’d also echo Woody’s sentiments. Is there a way you could start small? There are cc0 music tracks out there AND many cc0 animations within the Nouns community. How cool would it be to start there and make really clever repackaging of what already exists? Might be worth a shot!</p>
<p>Keep building friend!</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#how-this-project-proliferation-nouns-1" name="how-this-project-proliferation-nouns-1"></a>How This Project Proliferation Nouns .</h1>
<ul>
<li>Brand/Name Project</li>
<li>Every Content Has Nouns icon (Nouns glasses)</li>
<li>Support Nouns Entertainment</li>
<li>Funding Nouns Creator On PropHouse (Artist,Music Producer, Content Creator &amp; All About Nouns Entertainment) with Adsense &amp; Music Royalty</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p><em>Brand / Name Project + Nouns Icon</em></p>
<p>Developing a strong brand and icon in the entertainment industry can help to expand a community. A strong brand and icon will help to attract audience attention and increase their interest in the Nouns DAO community. It will also help to improve the community’s image as a leader in the entertainment field, making more people interested in joining the Nouns DAO community.</p>
<p>In addition, a strong brand and icon will also help to create a consistent experience for community members, making them feel comfortable and connected to the Nouns community.</p>
<p>Overall, developing a strong brand and icon in the entertainment industry will help to increase the visibility of the Nouns DAO community, increase audience interest in the community, and help to create a consistent experience for community members. All of this will help the Nouns DAO community to grow and develop quickly.</p>
<p><em>Suport Nouns Entertainment + Funding Nouns Creator</em></p>
<p>It Is generally a good idea to support the development of communities in the entertainment industry. Providing funding to communities can help them to grow and thrive, and can also benefit the larger entertainment industry as a whole. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as providing grants, offering mentorship and networking opportunities, and providing access to resources and tools that can help communities to grow and develop. In addition to benefiting the entertainment industry, supporting communities can also have a positive impact on the economy and society as a whole.</p>
<p>How Can We Fund Creators?</p>
<p>These are the Key Points on the Ecosystem Financial Aspect of the Project;</p>
<p>1, 20% of the Overall Project Revenue Will Be Allocated to the Core Team</p>
<p>2, 80% of the Revenue Will Be Used For Staking Investment</p>
<h1>
<a class="anchor" href="#investment-becomes-the-fortress-of-the-project-2" name="investment-becomes-the-fortress-of-the-project-2"></a>Investment Becomes the Fortress of the Project</h1>
<p>Limited funding can be a major challenge for the development of a project.

<p>To take this action, the first step is to identify and prioritize specific activities and resources that count towards the project’s continued growth and development. This may include things like additives or contractors, purchasing materials or equipment needed, or investing in research and development. Once these priorities are identified, it is important to allocate what is available in a way that maximizes the project’s chances of success. This may involve finding alternative sources of funding, such as selling products.</p>
