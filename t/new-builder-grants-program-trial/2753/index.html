<a class="anchor" href="#builder-grants-trial-1" name="builder-grants-trial-1"></a>Builder Grants - Trial</h1>
<p><strong>Core Issue:</strong> A lot of potential Nounish builders are not sure where to begin their work but are excited by the ecosystem - I know this because I was there just a month ago. The only place we actively incentivize them with ideas is Prop House mandated rounds. Otherwise, they must figure out problems themselves and then ask for money, a barrier that could prevent them from ever contributing.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Allocate funding to acquire new top-tier builders and let them explore the Nouns ecosystem pre-idea.</p>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#trial-run-2" name="trial-run-2"></a>Trial Run</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 grant = 4 ETH for 1 month of part-time exploration - over-paying slightly is <strong>critical</strong> to attracting talent that may not otherwise come to us
<ul>
<li><em>Context: a lot of the builders we are trying to attract are making &gt; $150,000 in their day jobs</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>10 builders (40 ETH) in fist trial run</li>
<li>3 people on operations multi-sig (mrtn, jihad, looking for 3rd)</li>
<li>Transparency (see operations)</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#eligibility-3" name="eligibility-3"></a>Eligibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Excluded - anyone who is actively working on a Nouns-funded project already (small grants, regular prop, prop house, etc…)</li>
<li>Must be working / exploring <em>something</em> while on grant, or will be revoked</li>
<li>Generally technically/product oriented - contract eng, full-stack eng, design, product</li>
<li>Operations team members not allowed to get a grant</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#operations-4" name="operations-4"></a>Operations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully transparently run by 3-person team</strong></li>
<li>Application process to vet builders, transparent public reasoning on accepting each builder
<ul>
<li>One of the slots can be decided by Nouner vote</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conduct check-ins and help builders find ideas, connect them to Nouners</li>
<li>Goal is to get each builder submitting an on-chain or Prop house prop by end of month
<ul>
<li>This will also help improve the builder onboarding process outside of the grants</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#concerns-5" name="concerns-5"></a>Concerns</h3>
<p><strong>But what if the builders take the money and don’t do anything?</strong> This is similar to everything in Nouns already - there’s a social contract to uphold, someone could always disappear after receiving 200 ETH on-chain. We can setup the grant via Sablier to revoke if a builder goes MIA, however. Additionally, if we can attract even half of the builders to stick around, the “acquisition cost” of those builders I’d argue is way higher - <em>successful companies pay at least five figures to attract top talent.</em></p>
<p><strong>What will they build?</strong> The first round will not have a particular mandate but future ones could be structured closer to Prop House mandated rounds, where there is a theme.</p>
<p><strong>Why not just run this on Prop House?</strong> Decisions are not always best made by large committees. Prop House rounds do not allow for deep conversation and analysis of candidates. A transparent, small committee allows for depth and betting on candidates who might not otherwise get a shot (i.e. people who aren’t good at writing a description on prop house but would be amazing builders).</p>
<p><strong>Why not just run this through NSFW / Small Grants?</strong> Small Grants has a great reach in terms of breadth, but there’s an opportunity to create programs that are more focused on depth, in this case builders. This can be a test of more opinionated sub-pods</p>

<p>I think it will be helpful to share your backgrounds + more info regards to operations.</p>
<p>Other than that, I am fully supportive of the more grants programs with narrow scopes. Both mrtn and jihad are proven builders and I don’t doubt that their expertise and passion for the ecosystem makes them well suited for the job.</p>

<p>Ive felt this problem myself and have a handful of friends who currently experience the same hurdles.</p>
<p>Very keen on exploring ways to solve this and happy that I’m not alone in noticing this bottleneck.</p>
<p>Im not sure the proposed solution is <em>it</em>, though?</p>

<p>Glad you’re thinking about it too! I’m not really attached to <em>this</em> solution, I’m more interested in solving the problem than anything else.</p>
<p>Would love to chat through other solutions / options if you have any. What are your concerns with this one - is it the process or price point?</p>
<p>For context, here’s how I view trade-offs of exploring this specific solution -</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Case Scenario: We get 5+ long-term builders out of this, great ROI on the 40 ETH, and we scale with small tweaks.</li>
<li>Mid-Case Scenario: We get a couple solid builders, but it’s unclear whether this is the best way to tackle this problem space. Decent ROI on the 40 ETH and we explore a different solution or make big changes. We’ve used our 40 ETH well and learned along the way.</li>
<li>Very Worst Case Scenario (pretty unlikely IMO): We get 0 real builders or output out of this and wasted 40 ETH. We iterate and explore a completely different way to tackle it. We learn but “lost” 40 ETH.</li>

<p>That sounds fantastic.  I mean, the possibilities of building with Nouns are endless, but the process of starting the execution makes it a little difficult.</p>
<p>There is an invisible barrier that separates the new great builders from the builders who are already building for the Nouns, an already approved prop can be significantly improved by a new builder, a new prop</p>

<p>The DAO has enough money to fund this off yield, not principal. Why not do that and completely protect the principal?</p>
