<p>Hello everyone, first time posting here. Not sure if this is the proper place to post this.<br/>
After reading this discord one of the recurring themes for Nouns is to do project that have an impact.<br/>
I was thinking about this for a while and one idea that keeps popping in my head is about filing taxes and how cumbersome that process can be for regular people when in fact it shouldn’t be.<br/>
I was wondering if nouns could fund project to make an app or site to help people file their taxes for free.<br/>
I understand that there are a lot of variations depending on which state you live and also depending on the personal circumstances. What I was thinking was to do the simplest case: a single or married person that works as an employee and does not have any other source of revenue. I know that there are thousand of reasons that can make this complicated or impossible to do but at the same time I feel that this can have a big impact on regular people. What do you think ?</p>

<p>Reposting my message from Discord here:</p>
<p>"I love this idea! In another life working at a fintech, we were working on a similar project to help homeless and poverty-stricken people complete back taxes. for many that have not filed taxes for many years, there can literally be thousands of dollars in refunds available to them, which is life-changing money if you’re sleeping on the street. Also, having an up-to-date tax record can sometimes open doors for social programs from a purely bureaucratic perspective. "</p>
<p>I circled back with my colleague that had been closer to the idea than I had been, and she shared some helpful info that is relevant to Canada:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free tax filing support is available to people with low incomes in Canada through programs at the federal and provincial level (<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/community-volunteer-income-tax-program.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">link</a>)</li>
<li>There are several grassroots community organizations that provide walk-in tax clinics as part of their financial literacy services to communities. It’s hands-on, in-person work. <a href="https://www.westnh.org/money/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Here’s an example of one</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.hrblock.ca/our-company/corporate-social-responsibility/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">H&amp;R Block offers free walk-in tax clinics in Canada</a>, partnering with shelters and non-profits to provide free, on-site tax preparation.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMO, those that would benefit most from this kind of service need professional, in-person help, since they are less likely to have access to a computer or phone or have the technical know-how to file taxes on their own.  There’s clearly a non-profit model for making this type of service available for free in shelters and community centers, so it would seem that it’s only a matter of connecting with qualified non-profits that are already doing this kind of thing at a grassroots level and funding them in order to scale their activities.</p>
<p>Would love to help in any way that I can, and can certainly bring in experts in Canada that can advise on the challenges, opportunities and best paths forward.</p>
