<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#tldr-1" name="tldr-1"></a>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>One high-risk issue found, <strong>unrelated to V2, in a function no one has used to date</strong> (more info below).</li>
<li>Three medium-risk issues found, <strong>all fixed as part of V2</strong>.</li>
<li>Some additional low-risk and gas optimizations found as well (not summarized in this post).</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a class="anchor" href="#the-high-risk-issue-delegate-by-signature-to-address-zero-2" name="the-high-risk-issue-delegate-by-signature-to-address-zero-2"></a>The high-risk issue: delegate by signature to address zero</h2>
<ol>
<li>The issue is in the <code>delegateBySig</code> function that’s part of <code>NounsToken</code>, only when the delegatee is address zero (<code>0x000...</code>).</li>
<li>When this function is used to delegate to address zero, the delegator wallet loses all its Nouns votes and can no longer transfer their Nouns out of that wallet.</li>
<li>To date there have been no uses of <code>delegateBySig</code>; <a href="http://nouns.wtf">nouns.wtf</a> and other governance clients have been using <code>delegate</code> which doesn’t have this issue.</li>
<li>To be extra safe, avoid using <code>delegateBySig</code>; if you must, triple check the message you’re signing is delegating to a non-zero delegatee.</li>
</ol>
<h3>
<a class="anchor" href="#what-is-delegatebysig-3" name="what-is-delegatebysig-3"></a>What is <code>delegateBySig</code>?</h3>
<p>It’s a function of <code>NounsToken</code> that is meant to support the use case of a Nouner signing a message with their intent to delegate, then passing that message to someone else to post on chain and pay gas.</p>
<p>This is part of a bigger concept of supporting “gasless transactions”, where various apps can allow you to submit transactions for free, or rather pay them for the gas in a currency other than ETH (e.g. your credit card, or some USD-pegged ERC20 token).</p>

<p>Verbs seems to have been a boon for the DAO and for the subDAOs. I think most people don’t have the technical chops to notice what you provide, myself included, but I saw a DAO’s launch contract cost go from something like 5 ETH to 1.5ETH because of the efficiencies you all have created. That is value that will be compounded many times over. That doesn’t factor the added security and I’m sure many other great additions you’ve made, so a hearty ‘Thank You’ from me. For the things I understand (very few) to the many I’ll probably never notice.</p>
