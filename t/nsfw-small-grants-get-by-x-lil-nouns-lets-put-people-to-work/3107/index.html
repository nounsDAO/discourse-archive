<p>This is the continuation of a discussion around this prop idea that was occurring in the Lil Nouns Prop Ideas section in the Lil Nouns Discord Channel here’s a link to that thread: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/1027324690655608963" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Discord</a>.</p>
<p>Title: <strong>“Get-By X Lil-Nouns - Let’s Put People to Work!”</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create co-branded merchandise to proliferate the NounsDAO while also raising awareness around Get-By and fair-chance hiring.</li>
<li>Support Get-By by funding launch expenses and initial Job Fair marketing efforts.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br/>
Get-By connects formerly incarcerated and underemployed people with small business owners looking to fill on-demand shifts. Get-By operates a mobile on-demand marketplace with pre-screened and pre-vetted applicants, allowing managers to make quick and data-driven hiring decisions while alleviating the stress of finding workers urgently. Get-By serves as an opportunity for the underemployed to establish professional relationships, credibility and begin on a path towards long-term employment. Get-By is an Anchorage Alaska based Business to Business Software and Staffing as a Service business. This first proposal/grant application will support Get-By by raising awareness around fair-chance hiring, supporting the business with a Nounified launch and associating the NounsDAO with a social impact business.</p>
<p>The funds proposed will be used to launch Get-By and to integrate Nounish Branding into the display of the Initial Get-By Job Fair Booth. The intention for this proposal is to lay the groundwork for future collaborations between Get-By and NounsDAO/Lil Nouns DAO in terms of marketing and connecting Web3 employment opportunities to formerly incarcerated and underemployed job seekers. This initial proposal will allow Lilskrtskrt to inform potential job seekers that the funding to launch Get-By was sourced from this community!</p>
<p><strong>Goal of Proposal:</strong><br/>
This nounish proposal seeks to build collaboration between the Lil Nouns DAO and a social impact business Get-By, proliferating the Nounish brand while making the ecosystem and community more accessible to more of our formerly incarcerated community members, bridging IRL, Workforce Development, and Web3.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Explanation:</strong><br/>
Through a CCO co-branding relationship lilskrtskrt.eth seeks to:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Proliferate the NounsDAO/Lil Nouns DAO Brand and Culture:</strong><br/>
<em>(Print T-shirts &amp; other Merch, Banners, LoFi Noggles, Contest at Booth, IRL Giveaways)</em></p>
<p>b. <strong>Associate the NounsDAO with goodwill and building social capital in marginalized communities:</strong><br/>
<em>(Co-branded Merch, Get-By is a social impact brand, targeting formerly incarcerated/underemployed workers, mutually beneficial brand building)</em></p>
<p>c. <strong>Launch Get-By and onboard the first cohort of workers ready to fill shifts:</strong><br/>
<em>(Use Successful Prop Funding from NounsDAO/Lil Nouns to launch a business to create jobs for people who need them, “every time a prop builder gets funded, that’s a part time job”, educate workers on how they can find Nouns funding to pursue their own dreams)</em></p>
<p>Future Proposals:</p>
<p><strong>Prop 2</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use Nounish Discords and channel partners to connect formerly incarcerated workers to Web3 employment opportunities in the NounsDAO/Lil Nouns DAO:<br/>
<em>(Try to source workers inside the Nouns/Lil Nouns ecosystem who are formerly incarcerated who need these opportunities, then look IRL too)</em>
</li>
<li>List accessible remote shifts available on the Get-By platform, connect workers from 1. with these shift opportunities and pay them using granted funds.</li>
<li>Refine roles and responsibilities for these shift workers NounsDAO/Lil Nouns DAO/ Web3 Community, and iterate.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prop 3</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Launch NounsDAO X Get-By Web3 Internship Program targeted at educating formerly incarcerated people and giving them an opportunity to be paid while developing skills in the NounsDAO/Lil Nouns DAO/Web3 ecosystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect Interns with shift/contract work in Web3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterate.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Proliferation/Utility:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This proposal will proliferate the NounsDAO/Lil Nouns DAO Brand, Meme, and Culture by proliferating the DAOs and subDAOs through its aesthetic use of the noggles and Lil Nouns characgers. The Get-By logo is aesthetically similar to the NounsDAO logo, the two logos will be displayed together. The nounish merchanidise that will be funded through this proposal will aid Lilskrtskrt in successfully launching the business while also raising awareness about the Nouns/Lil Nouns/Web3 ecosystems. Any interested parties who approach the Job Fair Booth will have the opportunity to (win/receive) merchandise at the Booth by playing a game or hashtagging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The culture of nounishness is synonymous with the values of Get-By:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Get-By was founded an attempt to solve a problem that Lilskrtskrt.eth faces himself, he saw a void in available opportunities and decided to create a solution that mathces his lived experience. He has bootstrapped the business to this point and has found difficulty in accessing traditional funding, while being unemployed. This proposal and collaboration, if successful, would provide adequate funding to launch the business and recruit a first cohort of shift workers. This proposal could be a pilot for setting standards/expectations for the the NounsDAO/Lil Nouns DAO for working with marginalized entrepreneurs.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>In addition to proliferating the meme and culture, this proposal would add goodwill and social capital to the ecosystem. It would draw the attention of organizations already involved in fair-chance work to the ecosystem (including this list of business businesses from the Second Chance Business Coalition that have made the second chance pledge: <a href="https://secondchancebusinesscoalition.org/press-releases/major-u-s-employers-commit-to-advancing-second-chance-employment" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><strong>https://secondchancebusinesscoalition.org/press-releases/major-u-s-employers-commit-to-advancing-second-chance-employment</strong></a>) This could be a new pathway to gain recognition from large stakeholders via building goodwill and being in the same room as people who care about change.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Team/Qualifications:</strong><br/>
Lilskrtskrt.eth has spent the last 7 years living in Anchorage as a reintegrated citizen. Post release he decided to formalize his technical abilities, learning to use data to inform decision making while performing database management and modeling analyses in life sciences and blockchain applications. He did so to be more competitive in the workplace. Ultimately Lilskrtskrt was not able to transition into professional roles due to a lack of credibility. Instead he has hopped from one small business to another working as a busser, dishwasher, delivery driver, food production assistant, server, cold caller, accounting technician, and data entry specialist. Get-By is the answer to this inefficient and ineffective pattern of employment, and his passion for technology and social justice. if you would like to hear more about Lilskrtskrts’s personal reentry story, please listen to the podcast posted above.</p>

Phase 5: Onboard cohort of (___) Get-By workers before Jan 30.<br/>
Phase 6: Lilskrtskrt.eth will compile social media engagement over the course of a 3 month<br/>
period and curate a video that shows nouners, lil nouners, and Get-By workers wearing the new merch and spreading awareness<br/>
around both nounsDAO and Get-By. This may also include Get-By workers working shifts with Client Businesses while wearing this nifty new merch.</p>
<p>(While Lilskrtskrt continues his work in advocacy and launching Get-By he will meet many people involved in the small business ecosystem, the reentry services ecosystem, and the venture capital ecosystem. There are opportunities to discuss the Nouns ecosystem and the democratization of community funded projects along the way, this has already begun.)</p>
<p>Phase 7: Video and content will be sharable no longer than 1 month after the first Job Fair.</p>
<p><strong>This video and all engagement will be CCO.</strong></p>
<p>Phase 8: Apply for follow on funding.</p>
<p><strong>Next Steps:</strong><br/>
<strong>Lilskrtskrt.eth uses raised capital to raise awareness and launch Get-By</strong>. Q1 2023 Get-By intends to recruit it’s first cohort of shift workers, no less than 10. These workers will have the option to commit to different shifts listed on the platform.</p>
<p><strong>If opportunities arise for Web3 “shift” or contract work, those opportunities can be listed on the Get-By platform with payout denominated primarily in USD.</strong> This could present a marketing opportunity for projects looking for work who are willing to source through the Web3/NounsDAO ecosystem, in doing so we could prove that they are employing marginalized folks which improves “DEI” efforts.</p>
<p><strong>In future rounds Get-By may return to the DAO for further support and assistance.</strong> This may vary from grant funding for Web3 shifts, to proposals requesting funding for training for workers, to additional merchandise, to developing piloting and implementing a Nouns based Web3 workforce development internship program.</p>
<p><strong>The scope for future funding requirements has not yet been determined.</strong> The total cost to operate the business for a year while employing 10 workers is no less than $30,000 (23.8ETH at time of writing 11/12 4:07p.m.)</p>
<p>Potential future revenue streams for the project may include integrating Lil Nouns or other Nouns subDAO tokens as incentives for shift workers, boosting proliferation, onboarding, and participation and involving a marginalized group of Americans who are often unheard from. There will be opportunities to receive certifications based on skill development such as the Nounishdojo, if integrated, these certifications could drive revenue back to the DAO and provide a training mechanism for underskilled potential workers to upskill to provide more value to the DAO, and Web3 as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>For future proposals:</strong> There may be future potential to create a subDAO around community driven proposals and participation that boost the stories of the formerly incarcerated and work to direct proposals in ways that are mutually beneficial for this group of potential community members.</p>

<p>If you’d like to check out one of my pitch videos I cover the market size for the United States and for Alaska specifically. Here are notes on the market size and the number of potential reentrants that might fill unfilled shifts.</p>
<p>In September 2022 there were a total of 1.6million total job openings across the US Hospitality Industry, that’s 32 million unfilled shifts in one month.<br/>
In the United States annually there are 650,000 ex-offenders released from incarceration, in Alaska 5,237 people. Alaska has the Nation’s highest recidivism rate at 66%.</p>
<p><strong>National Market Size:</strong><br/>
US: 15 million L&amp;H Employees<br/>
Absenteeism: 10 days/year average, $20/shift<br/>
=TAM for L&amp;H: $3.0b</p>
<p><strong>State Market Size:</strong><br/>
Alaska: 20,800 L&amp;H Employees<br/>
Absenteeism: 10 days/year average, $20/shift<br/>
=SOM for L&amp;H: $4.16m</p>
<p>In Anchorage here I already have 90+ people on a waitlist who have expressed interest in connecting with Get-By for shift work.</p>

<p>This is a really cool idea. I had a couple questions as I read through, both relating to the employment opportunities. What local employers do you think would be partners with this program and what web3 opportunities do you think there would be?</p>
<p>We’re working on something similar locally for addicts that are desiring to get clean and reintegrate into our local economy, so this is near to my heart as well.</p>
<p>For Nouns, this has big potential to create goodwill and have some awesome testimony videos if it takes off. Thanks for putting this together. I want to know more!</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<p>In regards to IRL employment opportunities, we’ll be launching here locally in Anchorage with opportunities at local restaurants and food production facilities initially! There are some notable local employers who have expressed interest in utilizing Get-By workers and many of them already have success stories of working with this population!</p>
<p>In regards to Web3 opportunities, I’m new to this ecosystem. I’ve noticed that a few people have many consolidated responsibilities in many facets and the opportunity to delegate seems ripe.</p>
<p>To be clear, sourcing Web3 opportunities will be prioritized in the second proposal once Get-By has established a labor pool.</p>
<p>I’d really appreciate the input of the Core team of people who currently have these responsibilities to weigh in on the opportunity to delegate responsibilities and funding to people who are marginalized, and how this is a real, present, abundant workforce development opportunity. At the very least some input from people in the ecosystem who do work on behalf of the DAO/subDAOs around what the work itself would entail.</p>
<p>There are surely other formerly incarcerated people in the ecosystem besides myself, let’s build this community to include them and put them to work too!</p>
<p>That’s awesome to hear that you’re working on something locally for addicts! Any work done to improve the outcomes of people reentering or in recovery is worthwhile in my opinion!</p>
<p>I totally agree! I think there’s a great opportunity here for me to tell my story about how I went through this process working and developing a prop, (getting it approved with community feedback) and describing the process so that other formerly incarcerated people see this as an opportunity to chase their dreams too! (This can also be said about my experience developing my business idea, following thru, executing and getting to where I am today, both stories are worth telling imho.)</p>
<p>Thanks again for your feedback! I pinged you in the Discord thread, would be glad to spend some time sharing more about myself and the business with you. (If you’d like to get a more personal side of my story, please check out the Podcast above!)</p>

<p>I’ve had the pleasure of chatting with <span class="mention">@lilskrtskrt</span> and I love this initiative. I find it to be admirable and think you have a solid plan for this 7 ETH first phase! I really hope we give you a shot to deliver this.</p>
<p>What do folks think is the best route to send <span class="mention">@lilskrtskrt</span> to seek this initial funding? DCS pod? I am under the impression that 7 ETH is too low to be considered for on chain?</p>

<p>I’m just following what has been recommended several times. Lil Al has mentioned NSFW in the Prop Ideas thread, so I figured I’d put it on discourse because I saw that’s the logical next step.</p>
<p>If a different funding channel is more appropriate, I am open to discussing that, but evaluating previous NSFW applications and the discourse itself, it does seem appropriate.</p>
<p>Additionally, if putting it on-chain is preferred, I’d appreciate votes/feedback on the Prop Lot that I’ve posted posted: <a href="https://lilnouns.wtf/proplot/99" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Prop Lot: Get-By X Lil Nouns: Let’s Put People To Work!</a></p>

<p>Thank you very much for your feedback about the Foodnouns Space, and about the current iteration of the Prop! I’d be more than interested in participating in additional twitter spaces as this Idea/ Draft is further fleshed out.</p>
<p>The larger prop, or next series of props include: creating work opportunities in the space for formerly incarcerated people, and then linking the continuuing education in web3 component to Nounsdojo/Nouns badges and making these available to these workers, and finally creating a paid internship program weaving all three together.</p>

<p>Responding to the Topic in this thread <a href="/t/how-much-nouns-have-you-been-funded-with/3002/8">How much Nouns $$$ have you been funded with?</a>:<br/>
I haven’t received any funding from NounsDAO or subDAOs for a Prop. I just submitted my first prop to the Discourse, and on Prop Lot.</p>
<p>I want to revisit two comments:</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Sam</span><br/>
“I don’t want to discourage folks from bringing props and ideas to the DAO, but I do think there needs to be an alignment of ideas and an understanding of the current market as well, asking the questions who does this prop benefit, does it really benefit the DAO, what kind of impact will it bring, what is it’s reach, what will the results be, what do they see as a success, will the DAO also think that is a success, how is it measured, what is the call to action, is this only a top funnel activity, if so why? And many many more.”</p>
<p>My prop benefits: People who need jobs, people in this ecosystem who haven’t come forward and identified as having experience with the justice system.<br/>
Does it benefit the DAO: Yes, proliferating and creating a space in the community for formerly incarcerated people.<br/>
What kind of impact will it bring: Massive. It could revolutionize reentry, workforce development, and the intersection of them in Web3.<br/>
What is it’s reach: There are 650,000 prisoners who return to our communities every year who may not know what’s next for them. By increasing the availability of employment options for them, we increase public safety. Massive Reach. Big businesses are actively involved in the second chance hiring movement.<br/>
Will the DAO think it’s a success? Who knows? If the DAO isn’t stoked on my idea does that mean I just quit? No, I don’t have any other choice, I keep moving forward.<br/>
How is it measured? Shifts, jobs, wages, web3 shift opportunities, recidivism metrics, public safety outcomes.<br/>
What is the call to action? People like myself are looking for opportunity. We are capable, we just haven’t gotten our foot in the door. This platform and fair chance hiring will be the glue that holds the employment relationship together for small businesses, or web3 entities, who want to give people who have made mistakes an opportunity to grow and prove themselves. It is not only a top funnel activity, it’s all about building a product for businesses that’s ready, and convenient, and takes the paperwork out of giving someone an opportunity.</p>

" 1. Am I focused on an idea that I <em>genuinely</em> care about?<br/>
2. Would I still be interested in pursuing this idea even <strong>without</strong> a promise of financial compensation?(i.e., as a hobby)<br/>
3. Is this something that benefits the Nouns ecosystem and the community more than it benefits myself?<br/>
4. Is this an idea that aligns with the Nouns ethos?<br/>
5. Am I doing everything I possibly can to make the proposal the best it can be?"</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes I’m a Felon myself, and in addition to trying to launch this business and make it a reality I’m actively involved in reentry advocacy in the State of Alaska.</li>
<li>Yes, I’ve been working on launching my business and working in this space for nearly 2 years now.</li>
<li>If this relationship between Get-By X Nouns ends up being a pipeline for workers to find opportunities in Web3 that allow them to elevate their lives while contributing to the work, that would benefit the community far more than just benefitting myself. My goal of starting a business was never to try to become rich, it was to solve the problem that I’m still facing today.</li>
<li>I think it’s an idea that aligns with the Nouns ethos yes.</li>
<li>I am currently doing everything that I possibly can to make this proposal the best it can be, <strong>including asking as many people as I can for feedback</strong>.</li>
