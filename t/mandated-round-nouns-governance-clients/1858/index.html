<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am proposing we execute another mandated round for 100 ETH to fund 5 teams @ 20 ETH each with the mandate to build alternative Nouns Governance clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a class="anchor" href="#summary-1" name="summary-1"></a>Summary</h1>
<p>Given the success of our first mandated round, I am proposing that we kick-off a second mandated round for Nouns governance clients. For folks who missed it: an overview of the Nouns Client round:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://prop.house/nouns-mandates">35 proposals</a> from top caliber builders</li>
<li>1416 votes casted (a record for Prop House)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse/status/1551692309116379137">4 teams funded</a></li>
<li>A record breaking % of highly desirable proposals</li>
<li>Noun-pilled top quality folks</li>
</ul>
<p>This time around, we’d be inviting builders to propose ideas for an alternative Nouns Governance clients. While our classic <a href="https://nouns.wtf/vote">nouns.wtf/vote</a> gets the job done, there is a lot more to explore regarding Nouns governance. This might take several directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegation marketplace</li>
<li>Better info curation to make more informed decisions</li>
<li>New voting mechanisms for Nouners to better signal prior to going on-chain</li>
<li>Post-funding trackers</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing to note is that there are good ideas outside of the community and highly competent builders ready to execute on them. Prop House mandated rounds are a way to not only build up the Nouns ecosystem but also onboard top-notch builders as well.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" href="#scope-2" name="scope-2"></a>Scope</h1>
<p>The mandate would be an open-ended around Nouns Governance such that any client that follows the prompt to improve Nouns Governance is welcome.</p>
<p>The round will be hosted on the <a href="https://prop.house/nouns-mandates">Nouns Mandates house</a> with 3 weeks proposal time and 1 week for voting.</p>
<p>Any feedback prior to putting this on-chain is welcome!</p>

<p>Incredibly excited about this. There’s so much design space around this area, and I’m glad to see it explored via a mandated Prop House. We’ve been noodling on some governance clients ideas, and would be excited to pitch them during the next round.</p>

<p>This was the kick in the butt I needed to consolidate a list of governance experiments I’d like to see. Published these ideas in <a href="/t/discussion-request-for-nounish-governance-experiments/1859">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>I think this is very cool <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" width="20"/> Just thinking that we have more to learn from the first mandated round, so might be worthwhile to wait with this round a bit longer, until we see what people actually end up building, and what the DAO’s reactions might be to those outcomes.</p>

<p>Fair take. What do you think could go off with the first round that would turn us off from moving forward with this? What are the signals/timelines you’d be looking for?</p>
<p>While I agree to some degree, I want to take advantage of builder momentum we currently have. Feels like there’s good pent up demand from highly competent builders wanting to join the ecosystem.</p>

<p>to senecas point, i think i would be in favor of another round even if round 1 projects all turn out to be disasters — the underlying mechanic of prop house mandates are too strong to not cont playing around with</p>
