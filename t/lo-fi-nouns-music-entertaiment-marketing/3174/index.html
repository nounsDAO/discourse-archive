<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>Lo-Fi art and music production, Non-stop Live streaming</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Lo-Fi is a type of music that brings a calm atmosphere because it contains natural sounds that we often encounter in our daily life, such as raindrops, the friction between the glass and the lid, the whispers of people while talking, and so on. The tone or rhythm used in Lo-Fi is usually repeated and the duration of the song is quite short. It is natural sounds that are used to support Lo-Fi music to be more colorful. Until now Lo-Fi music continues to grow and many other types of songs are changed to the Lo-Fi version to get the calm atmosphere that only Lo-Fi has. Initially Lo-Fi hit again through the SoundCloud music platform, but now we can listen to Lo-Fi music through other platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, and music streaming websites such as Chillhop and TuneIn.</p>
<p>The calm aura generated by Lo-Fi is generally used by teenagers or those who want to be more focused when doing something. Lo-Fi music can be the right choice to accompany us while studying at home. Not only does it help us focus more, Lo-Fi can also help us feel more relaxed. Usually Lo-Fi music playlists are arranged based on a certain theme or atmosphere, for example for studying, meditation, morning mood, and so on. We can adjust the existing playlist options to our needs and moods. Therefore the key to always be enthusiastic about studying at home is to prepare a positive mood and place to study and maintain health so that the body condition remains fit. Greetings! (han, bbs).</p>
<p><strong>Research</strong></p>
<p>I researched more important thing and <a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Lofi Girl’s</a> youtube channel (Largest Lo-fi youtube channel ) and came up with important info :</p>
<p>This YouTube channel/account was created on</p>
<p>March 18th, 2015</p>
<p>since last year Lofi Girl has grown rapidly and has 8 million subscribers until now Lofi Girl has 11 million subscribers, The youtube channel has 354 videos since they started their youtube, and currently Lofi Girl has 43.8k - 7m weekly average views, with a total view of 1.4B .</p>
<p>with an estimated earnings 50k-115k monthly.</p>
<p>Behind Lo-FI fame</p>
<p>In the midst of a busy schedule, often a person feels tired or stressed. It encourages someone to seek entertainment to calm down. One popular choice is listening to music and lo-fi music is often considered. Many people commented positively that lo-fi improves concentration. Therefore, it’s not surprising that the lo-fi music covers used are vector art or pictures of someone studying. Lo-fi music is also often used to just enjoy me-time, so it’s no wonder that this song is in great demand among young people. With its low radio-quality sound and largely devoid of lyrics, many people listen to it when they’re too bored or bored with other mainstream songs.</p>
<p>Why is Lo-Fi music an option?<br/>
<img alt="image" data-base62-sha1="5udX2Mh419sD15mwGlA3VzS0OzW" height="426" src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/nouns/original/2X/2/267587dede889bbd4313e84beb905732846e113c.png" width="640"/></p>
<p>Lo-Fi music is a fresh new option. Previously, slow tempo music was synonymous with classical music. More or less both of them have the same effect: make the listeners calmer and calmer. However, not everyone can accept classical music. Several pieces of classical music are actually inseparable from relatively fast tempos, so this music classification cannot fully be used as an alternative back sound for study music and mainstay relaxation music.</p>
<p>in the end it comes down to everyone’s taste and acceptance.</p>

<p>Lo-fi is very nounish. This could be a cool proliferation tool, as well as a prop that moves into self-funding.</p>
<p>The breakdown is a little vague, especially the art production. I think that examples of work are needed from this project. Creating a retro-funded MVP would be preferable.</p>
<p>I hope the team re-works the prop to include more details and examples. In its current form it is a no from me, but with a few tweaks, this would be an easy yes for an MVP.</p>

<p>Great idea in general, though I believe Nouns’ default soundtrack is <em>8-Bit</em> / <em>Chiptune</em> lol. So it’ll be very entertaining to see some Nouns chilln out to LoFi. And I did not realize LoFi was so HiFi, financially <img alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" height="20" loading="lazy" src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" width="20"/></p>
