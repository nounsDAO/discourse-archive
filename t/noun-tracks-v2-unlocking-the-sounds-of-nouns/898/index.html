<p>We’ve discussed using J Viewz as the executive producer and producer on the project as they already have experience doing something like this and making it work.</p>
<p>Through my network I’m offering to reach out to accredited and known musicians if we think that is cool.  I also think there are a lot of music creation DAO’s and communities that we could tap for sounds.</p>
<p>I also think we can find interesting ways to distribute these through traditional channels that can spread awareness.  For instance they could go on all the major DSP’s (Spotify, Apple, Etc) or we could offer these as CC0 samples for producers through Splice or similar production/sample libraries.</p>
