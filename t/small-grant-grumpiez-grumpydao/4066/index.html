<p>Hello Nouns, we aren’t specifically looking for an exact figure of funding, more so awareness and allocations for current nouns holders to join another Governance model on the Solana Blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>What are we about?</strong><br/>
GrumpieZ is a CC0 project giving all governance power to GrumpyDAO. Inspired by <a href="http://Nouns.wtf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nouns.wtf</a> on Ethereum and the recent on-goings on Solana in Q1 of 2023 we felt it needed change.</p>
<p>GrumpieZ Holders govern GrumpyDAO as well as the treasury. Proposals can be submitted by any holder of 5 GrumpieZ or more and one NFT will act as one vote against each proposal. We aim to create a truly fair governance model similar to nouns which doesn’t have a board nor executive body. Utilizing the CC0 IP allows us to waive copyright and allow anyone to utilize our IP in the public domain to further strengthen our brand.</p>
<p><strong>Governance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proposals</strong><br/>
Proposals can be submitted by any holder of 5 or more GrumpieZ tokens. Your proposal should consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the proposal?</li>
<li>How will it benefit GrumpyDAO</li>
<li>How much of treasury funds are required</li>
<li>A break down of how funds will be used</li>
<li>KPIs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Voting</strong><br/>
One GrumpieZ token will count for one vote either for or against the proposal submitted.</p>
<p><strong>Delegation</strong><br/>
If you wish you will be able to delegate your vote to the council if you do not have time to vote. This will be similar to a staking contract where you will be able to delegate / un-delegate your GrumpieZ token at any time.</p>
<p>As you can see, we have taken inspiration from NOUNS for a similar model on the Solana Blockchain. We’d love to here more from you / your council if this is of interested.</p>
