<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>We propose the creation of an NFT Pokedex application, a tool that allows users to keep track of their NFT collections, similar to how a Pokedex allows users to keep track of their Pokemon collections. The application will have several key features such as a catalog, search, portfolio, scanner, market, and social features.</p>
<p>It will be accessible through a mobile device and web platforms, and it will offer different levels of access, such as a free version that allows users to access basic features and a paid version that allows them to access advanced features such as market data and portfolio analysis.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><em>Scanner:</em> A feature that uses the device’s camera to scan QR codes on NFTs, making it easy for users to add new NFTs to their collection.</p>

<p>I have a few questions about the proposal. First will it be integrated into the current Nouns application? What projects have you/ your team developed in the past?</p>

<p>If such an implementation is possible - it is interesting. In the original concept, the application is a separate product that complements the ecosystem.</p>
<p>As for development experience, my colleagues have it. I specialize more in working with media and design. I am ready to provide developers for the project if the community is seriously interested in the concept.</p>

<p>I like your idea, how do you and your team manage to keep it up to date or would it need some maintenance to keep it up to date?</p>
