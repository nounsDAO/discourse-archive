<p>Would love feedback on this idea that we are launching.  Please see our proposed project below.</p>
<p>⌐◨-◨ Nounish Consultants</p>
<p>tl:dr: Offering a valuable new benefit to builders in the Nouns ecosystem supporting their efforts proliferating the meme. ⌐◨-◨</p>
<p>As the Nouns ecosystem expands, especially with the success of Prop House, we see nounish builders struggle with business aspects, strategy, management, legal and tax issues, and more.<br/>
We’ve also seen builders who have won grants get stuck in moving forward or those who have created proposals and drop off the radar after not winning.</p>
<p>We are experienced consultants of various expertise building a supportive network that assists nounish builders in their success. We want to help with the ramp-up of these projects and make sure that those who are building in the Nouns ecosystem have support for their ongoing efforts.</p>
<p>The idea:<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Create a private Discord with access to specific qualifying builders.<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Experts in the area of business, strategy, law, tax, marketing, and other areas as requested will hold workshops and office hours to assist both the group as a whole as well as one-on-one.<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Discord server access is available to Nouners, Nouncillors, proposal and small grants recipients, and prop house winners.<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Provide a space for founders/project leads to also share ideas/feedback with each other.<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Workshop topics and guest speakers are determined by the needs of builders.<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Start with a one-month trial/MVP to test out the market needs.<br/>
⌐◨-◨ For MVP trial, funding will be sought via small grants.</p>
<p>The Pilot/MVP:<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Cohort of 8 to 10 builders/founders/project leads for individual coaching, tailored workshops and calls, and founder support via a private discord.<br/>
⌐◨-◨ 4 week pilot program with one individual session per week, one group session per week and daily check-ins.<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Ideal candidates are leading a nounish project or business and would like support while building. Interested builders should contact either <span class="mention">@emmavancrypto</span> or <span class="mention">@profwerder</span> with questions or to apply for the pilot cohort.</p>
<p>Who we are:</p>
<p>⌐◨-◨ Emma <span class="mention">@emmavancrypto</span> (Twitter), <span class="mention">@emma</span>/nouns gal (Discord)</p>

<p>Emma is Mike Judge’s NFT Manager and launched his first CC0 character on <a href="http://www.JoeSodium.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.JoeSodium.com</a>. She’s also advised companies with their NFT projects helping with strategy, business development, community building, operations, and scaling their businesses efficiently. She’s a former tech startup founder and has also advised a variety of CPG and technology startups at all stages. Emma’s excited to make a bigger impact by supporting creators and builders in the nouns community.</p>
<p>Nounish contributions:<br/>
⌐◨-◨ Introduced Mike Judge to the Nouns community<br/>

<p>We’ve both been informally advising various builders in the space but nothing concrete from start to finish. This has been an idea I’ve had for a while and was emphasized when Toady asked for assistance with a Prop House spaces to give support to builders. I ended up creating a Nounish Business Model Canvas as a tool to help those who are starting to build. Most of our coaching has been on a more informal basis via dm’s.</p>
<p>In terms of this start-up, originally we had a broader pilot in mind with a 9eth budget but scaled it back based on feedback from Skilift to a one month pilot and keeping it smaller with more personalized coaching/attention. So for start-up we have paired it down to 2 eth total (1eth each). Some of the funds would also go to honorariums for guest speakers for workshops to expand the expertise offered.</p>
<p>I’d like to see this scaled as a public goods type of benefit to builders in the space so that they don’t lose momentum and so we don’t lose good builders who just don’t have support when challenges arise. This could be eventually expanded to other cc0 projects as well, similar to the expansion of Prop House, where those forks/projects provided the funding to support their builders.</p>
<p>And with the shift to a cohort structure, we can also build in a mentorship from one cohort to another, eventually bringing on new coaches/advisors to the project as we expand.</p>

<p>⌐◨-◨ tl:dr: Offering a valuable new benefit to builders in the Nouns ecosystem supporting their efforts proliferating the meme by providing resources and support in the areas of business strategy and development, legal and tax, mental health and navigating the nounish ecosystem.</p>
<p>As the Nouns ecosystem expands, especially with the success of Prop House, we see nounish builders struggle with business aspects, strategy, management, legal and tax issues, mental health and more. We’ve also seen builders who have won grants get stuck in moving forward or those who have created proposals and drop off the radar after not winning.</p>
<p>The idea was to create a support network specifically for nounish builders, creating a Nouns version of an incubator/accelerator. A four-week pilot funded at 2 ETH with positive results and a better understanding of builder needs. We present some key findings and recommended next steps below.</p>
<p>Supertight Woody:</p>
<p>“Nounish Consultants have created a niche community that harbors healthy, sustainable growth within NounsDAO. I’m looking forward to see where Emma and Prof take this project and excited to contribute however I can!”</p>
<p>Key Findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mental Health - Burnout is real and everyone is struggling with mental health. The resources provided and small group session was beneficial and seen as something we need more of, via professional assistance and community support.</li>
<li>Intimate conversations in a less chaotic environment made it easier to meet people, build relationships and collaborate. We need a virtual Coffee Shop.</li>
<li>Need more proposal guidance and feedback and recommend creating some resources such as templates and best practices tips, as well as sessions with community mentors who have successfully gotten props passed.</li>
<li>Expert Professionals were helpful and more are needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although many entrepreneurial people manage to connect easily in the Nouns Discord or via Twitter, others get lost and find it hard to cut through the noise. Creating a smaller environment where everyone was coming in at the same time and introducing themselves, made for an easier approach. Rekola noted the “warmness and openness we established,” made it a safe place to come freely and propelled him in moving forward to having a virtual coffee with Woody. This gave us an idea to create a virtual coffee shop as we move forward that could also serve to match up individuals who may have needs in common.</p>

<p>“I absolutely think this is worthwhile to continue. A place like this where people can come to for specific advice is valuable. The first mental health talk I went to has been helpful in jumpstarting some good habits like journaling and working on how I phrase things. I also think networking within a small group like this is helpful for direct feedback on proposals and how to share them.”</p>

<ol>
<li>Discussion on utility for NFT projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Emma Asked: What are some of your favorite types of utility that you’ve come across?</p>
<ol>
<li>Seva’s Take:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Providing IRL value</li>
<li>Royalties are one of my favorite utilities so far. But I don’t think the value is just there. Thinking of NFTs/CC0/DAOS/Treasury/Privacy… It is a new dawn of organizations and networks wasn’t possible before. What could we do with 10, 20, 100s of NounsDAOs?</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Klim’s Take:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The idea of perpetual royalties for the work that are on chain and can transfer to your kids and grandkids.</li>

<p>Wednesday, August 31st</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discussion on Negotiating with Emma</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Doing your research (finding comparables, reaching out to folks if not publically available)</li>
<li>Being patient and also try not to have all your eggs in one basket</li>
<li>Being assertive and persistent. Follow up with the next steps and send concise messages.</li>
<li>“Everything is negotiable”</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: If the price goes up $100, ask if they can do $30 instead. You may be surprised!</p>
<ul>
<li>Have boundaries and be careful of people pleasing.</li>
<li>Be confident and positive. Have a good self-care plan. Know your worth and stick to it! If you’re going to do something for free or less than your rate, try to have a plan in place if “x happens, you get y” or ask yourself if you do this for a discount, will it be worth your time still, if it may lead to more experience and more business in the future, etc.</li>
<li>Listen to the other party’s concerns if there is pushback and make sure to address the concerns and find a solution.</li>
<li>Write down your success story - Pick a few things you’re proud of and read them as a reminder</li>
<li>If you’re having a bad day, good to journal out how you feel and tear the paper up after. Also know feelings are temporary and many folks go through similar experiences. Good to have someone you can soundboard with</li>

<p>There is value in an effort like this but we are still in the MVP/development stage. We propose an additional 2 month trial with additional structure and larger reach. We would like to still bring people in as cohorts but open it at the beginning of each month to any Nounish builders, Nouncillors, Nouners or Nounders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up to new cohort —applications would open to any nounish builders</li>
<li>Applications just to vet so we make sure we have the right folks in there who are actually building in the ecosystem</li>
<li>Daily Accountability Topics</li>
<li>Virtual coffee shop connecting builders</li>
<li>Weekly Business Development/Strategy Sessions and Office Hours w/Emma</li>
<li>Business Resources and Discussion Topics of Interest w/Emma</li>
<li>Weekly office hours w/prof</li>
<li>Emma &amp; prof to organize experts, add resources, daily contact in discord, etc</li>
<li>Weekly expert session</li>
<li>Mental health session/resources</li>
<li>Bring in 2–4 community mentors to focus on prop development and similar nounish specific stuff</li>
<li>Use this platform to build connections between builders and identify needs within the ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<p>New budget for 2 month trial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emma: 3 eth/month (15hrs/wk approx-primary admin/comm manager)</li>
<li>Prof: 1 eth/month (5 hrs/wk approx, backup admin/mod)</li>
<li>Experts: .5 /month of direct via retro (max 4 per month —legal, tax, mental health etc)</li>
<li>Community mentors: .5 /mo retro (max 4 per month) — They would have specific area they would do a session on &amp; be available for an assigned week.</li>

<p>I’m a huge fan of anything that is deepening genuine human relationships in Nouns. Would have loved this if it had been here when I first entered the ecosystem. Excited to see where this goes.</p>

<p>Hi ferrodi - we put this on hold since it wasn’t funded for another round. We are exploring other options but in the meantime, the discord is open and I’d be happy to chat with you and see how I can assist!</p>

<p>Great idea. I’m sure bc of who you are it will be approved. I am for sure interested in this…it would add great value but would you plz give more detail on this “⌐◨-◨ Experts in the area of business, strategy, law, tax, marketing, and other areas as requested will hold workshops and office hours to assist both the group as a whole as well as one-on-one.” as it is pretty much the whole backbone of this prop so to speak.</p>

<p>For the pilot we did have a session with an IP attorney and also did a mental health session with a licensed professional and you can see some of the resources and information in the discord. If we did revive this specific prop and if funding was found, we could be a bit more specific but did not engage beyond this since no funding to move to the next phase was approved.</p>
<p>I do see this becoming a part of a larger initiative that I am working on so please stay tuned and I will update at a later time.  For now, please pop by the discord: <a class="inline-onebox" href="https://discord.gg/CmRkBvJf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Nounish Consultants</a></p>
